To achieve this goal, they launched a series of aggressive military campaigns and invasions, starting with the annexation of Austria in 1938, followed by the occupation of Czechoslovakia and the invasion of Poland in 1939, which marked the beginning of World War II.\n\nAs Nazi Germany expanded its territory, it increasingly came into conflict with other major powers, such as France, Britain, and the Soviet Union. These countries formed alliances to counter Nazi aggression and ultimately defeated Germany in a long and brutal war.\n\nThe war resulted in millions of deaths and widespread destruction, and it had a profound impact on the world. It led to the rise of the United States and the Soviet Union as superpowers, the formation of the United Nations, and the establishment of a new world order that prioritized international cooperation and collective security.\n\nIn summary, the imperialist aspirations of Nazi Germany under Hitler led to global conflict by provoking the aggression of other major powers and ultimately sparking World War II.

Hitler also pursued a policy of rearmament, which violated the terms of the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I and imposed restrictions on Germany's military.\n\nThe Nazi regime used its military power to aggressively expand German territory, starting with the annexation of Austria in 1938 and the occupation of Czechoslovakia the same year. In 1939, Germany invaded Poland, which led to the outbreak of World War II.\n\nHitler's aggressive militarism was fueled by his belief in the superiority of the German people and the need for Lebensraum, or \"living space,\" for the German race. He sought to create a vast empire that would include much of Europe and parts of Africa and Asia.\n\nThe Nazi regime's militarism was also closely tied to its ideology of racial supremacy and its desire to eliminate what it considered to be inferior races, such as Jews, Romani, homosexuals, and people with disabilities. This led to the Holocaust, the systematic murder of six million Jews and millions of others during World War II.\n\nIn summary, the aggressive militarism of Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler was driven by a combination of imperialist ambitions, racial supremacy, and a belief in the need for military power to achieve these goals. It led to the outbreak of World War II and the devastating consequences that followed.\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "What was Hitler's plan for Germany and the role anti-semitism and extreme nationalism played in his vision"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Adolf Hitler's plan for Germany, as outlined in his book Mein Kampf, was to create a \"Greater Germany\" that would become a dominant world power. He believed that the German people were a superior race and that they needed to expand their territory and resources to achieve their full potential.\n\nAnti-Semitism and extreme nationalism played a central role in Hitler's vision for Germany. He believed that Jews were a destructive force in society and that they were responsible for many of the problems facing Germany, such as economic hardship and social unrest. He argued that the Jews were a threat to the purity of the German race and needed to be eliminated.\n\nHitler's extreme nationalism was based on the idea that the German people were destined to rule the world. He believed that Germany had been unfairly treated by other countries following World War I and that it was necessary to regain its rightful place in the world through military conquest and the establishment of a vast empire.\n\nHitler's anti-Semitic and nationalist beliefs were reflected in the policies of the Nazi regime, which systematically persecuted and murdered Jews and other minority groups, and aggressively pursued military expansion and conquest.\n\nOverall, Hitler's vision for Germany was based on an extreme form of nationalism that emphasized the superiority of the German race and the need for military power to achieve their goals. This was coupled with a deep-seated hatred of Jews and other minorities, which led to some of the most horrific crimes in human history.\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "How the multinational corporation, Nissan Motor Co changed the global economy beginning in 1933-1934 CE"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. is a multinational automobile manufacturer based in Japan.

There were several factors that contributed to the delay in women's suffrage in Turkey.\n\nOne of the main reasons was the conservative and patriarchal attitudes that prevailed in Turkish society at the time. Women were seen as subordinate to men and their primary role was seen as being in the home, caring for children and household duties. These attitudes were deeply ingrained in Turkish culture and were reinforced by religious and social norms.\n\nAnother factor was the political instability and turmoil that Turkey experienced in the early 20th century. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire, Turkey went through a period of political upheaval and instability, which made it difficult to enact significant social reforms.\n\nHowever, despite these obstacles, there were also significant social and political changes taking place in Turkey during this period. The country was undergoing a process of modernization and secularization, which included the promotion of women's rights and education.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, women's organizations began to emerge in Turkey, advocating for women's suffrage and other rights. These groups were supported by some of the country's leading intellectuals and politicians, who recognized the importance of women's participation in the political process.\n\nIn 1934, under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, Turkey's first president, a new constitution was adopted that granted women the right to vote and stand for election. This was part of a broader program of modernization and secularization, which aimed to transform Turkey into a modern, Western-style democracy.\n\nOverall, the late adoption of women's suffrage in Turkey was due to a combination of conservative attitudes, political instability, and social and cultural changes. However, the emergence of women's organizations and the support of progressive leaders were key factors in finally achieving this important milestone for women's rights in Turkey.\n\n"}], "id": "oP9pta5", "lang": "en"}

Can you explain these: structured data, unstructured data, ACID transactions, and sharding"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Sure, here's an explanation of the terms you mentioned:\n\n1. Structured data: Structured data refers to data that is organized in a specific format or schema. This can include data stored in relational databases, spreadsheets, or CSV files. It is data that can be easily searched, sorted, and analyzed because it has a predefined format and structure.\n2. Unstructured data: Unstructured data, on the other hand, refers to data that does not have a predefined format or structure. This can include data such as text documents, images, videos, and audio files. Unstructured data can be more difficult to search, sort, and analyze because it does not have a predefined format.\n3. ACID transactions: ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These are a set of properties that ensure that database transactions are processed reliably. Atomicity means that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work and it is either completed in full or not at all. Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another. Isolation ensures that concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that would be obtained if transactions were executed serially. Durability ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it will survive permanently, and it will be recoverable even in case of hardware failures.\n4. Sharding: Sharding is a method of horizontally partitioning data across multiple servers or databases. This allows you to scale a database by distributing the data across multiple servers. This method is often used to handle large amounts of data or high traffic. When data is sharded, each shard is a separate and independent unit of storage and processing, allowing for more efficient and effective scaling.\n\nPlease note that, in the context of a CAT tool, sharding is not necessarily a must-have feature, but it can be helpful in case the tool needs to handle large amounts of data, or high traffic.\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "Can you explain ACID transactions in a way a 5-year-old would understand?"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Sure, here's a simple explanation of ACID transactions that a 5-year-old might understand:\n\nACID is like a set of rules that helps computers keep track of things that are happening in the right order.

MongoDB uses a technique called \"eventual consistency\" which means that when a write is made to the database, it may take some time for that write to propagate to all the replicas of the data. This can lead to a situation where different replicas of the data have different values, and a read operation could return different results depending on which replica it reads from.\n\nIn contrast, other NoSQL databases like Cassandra and Riak provide tunable consistency, which allows you to choose the level of consistency that is appropriate for your application.

Create a database and collections: Once MongoDB is installed, you can connect to the server and create a new database for your CAT tool. Within the database, you will need to create collections to store the translation memory (TM) and terminology data.\n3. Design the schema: Next, you will need to design the schema for the TM and terminology collections. The schema will define the structure of the documents that will be stored in the collections, including the fields and their data types. You will also need to create indexes to support efficient querying of the data.\n4. Import the data: Once the schema is designed, you will need to import the TM and terminology data into the collections. This can be done using the MongoDB import tool, which allows you to import data from a CSV or JSON file.\n5. Develop the API: Next, you will need to develop the API that will allow the CAT tool to access the TM and terminology data stored in MongoDB. The API should provide methods for querying the data, inserting new translations, and updating existing translations.

Limited number of developers and translators: Due to the limited number of Persian speakers and developers with expertise in Persian, it may be difficult to find the necessary resources to develop and maintain a CAT tool for Persian language users.\n\nIt is important to consider these challenges and plan accordingly when developing a CAT tool for Persian\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "What do you mean about ambiguity in Persian?"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "In linguistic terms, ambiguity refers to the property of a word, phrase or sentence that allows multiple interpretations. Persian language, like many other languages, has a number of words that can have multiple meanings depending on the context in which they are used. This can make it challenging to develop a CAT tool that can provide accurate translations, as the tool may have difficulty determining the correct meaning of a word or phrase.\n\nFor example, the Persian word \"b\u0101r\" can have several meanings such as 'time', 'place', 'bar', 'pressure' depending on the context. Also, words like \"k\u0101r\" can have meanings like 'work' 'action' 'deed' 'job' etc.\n\nAdditionally, Persian idiomatic expressions, proverbs, and colloquialism can be ambiguous and hard to translate. These idiomatic expressions are often culturally-bound and may not have a direct translation in other languages.\n\nIn summary, ambiguity in Persian refers to the property of the language that allows multiple meanings for words, phrases, and idiomatic expressions, which can make it difficult to develop a CAT tool that can provide accurate translations and handle all the nuances of the language.\n\n"}], "id": "W60MP3g", "lang": "en"}

It is achromatic, odourless, and featureless, the \"enemy of matter and life\".[6] Therefore, it can only be measured through the matter that surrounds it.[7] Where matter borders the pale, the resulting border is an uproar of matter, evaporating into the pale, considered \"a great vision\".[8] The area of transition between the world and the pale is called \"porch collapse\": a grey mist with cold vapour, known to house a specialized form of fungal microorganism.[9]\n\nPale is difficult to describe and measure, as it is something whose fundamental property is the suspension of properties: physical, epistemological, linguistic.[10] The further into pale you travel, the steeper the degree of suspension. Right down to the mathematical \u2013 numbers stop working. No one has ever passed the number barrier since the discovery of the pale and it may be impossible.[11]\n\nOne of the few measurable effects of the pale is that it is expanding at an unknown rate.[12]\n\nTravel:\nThe pale was, at one time, thought to be unending and impenetrable. Irene La Navigateur, the Queen of Suresne, sent eight expeditions, one after the other, into the mass at the edge of the world. Five of the crews did not return. Two others lost their minds.[13] After years of trial and error, the eighth expedition returned, sane and intact. They told of a new continent of matter. They told the queen and her councillor, Dolores Dei, that the pale had begun to condense, day after day, hour after hour, minute after minute,[14] leading to the discovery of a new isola: the Insulinde, the \"freckled face of god\".[15]\n\nTheir travel was made possible by the fact that, using a device known as a pale latitude compressor, is possible to force dimensions on the pale, bouncing radio waves from one end to the other and shortening the path.[16] However, the only real advance in pale transit is the speed with which an aerostatic craft can pierce it -- less exposure leads to fewer adverse effects later.[17] Aerostatics are hybrid airships, necessary as conventional rotors or jet engines no longer add velocity after the point of reference for motion is suspended once they cross from near pale to far pale.[18]\n\nOver-radiation, caused by prolonged exposure to the pale, is a horrible feeling and international standards strictly limit civilian travellers to six days of pale exposure per year.[19] Members of the Entroponetic Business Class are specifically cleared and trained for 22 days of pale travel annually.[20] Workers who transport goods through the pale are known as paledrivers,[21] and some experience overradiation through vivid flashbacks, living out past memories from lives that may or may not be theirs.\n\nIn order to transmit radio signal between isolas, a number of pale-based repeater stations are needed, though working on those is said to be an incredibly dangerous and mentally taxing job.[22] On occasion, signal that is routed through the pale gets mixed up, sending instead conversations recorded elsewhere or years ago.[23] In exceedingly rare cases, the pale may transmit information from the future.[24] [25]\n\nThere are also signs of pretermodern crossings. Successful navigation of the pale relies not just on technical know-how, but intensive psychic preparation.[26] Some of these tactics have been known for thousands of years, such as Volta do Mar,[27] which resembles the process of writing poetry.[28]\n\nStudy:\nEntroponetics is the scientific study of the pale. The pale has been studied for thousands of years in one way or another and the most recent iteration of it comes from Graad. The study of the pale reaches back as far as 6,000 years, to the Mundi isola and the Perikarnassians, who called it the Western Plain.[29] They had not travelled the entire circumference of the Perikarnassian super-isola and assumed it was simply a feature of the west, not yet aware of its omnipresence.[30]\n\nSome consider isolary entroponetics, that is, the idea of pale being able to form from inside an isola, a hoax. However, the phenomenon is proven,[31] one example being the point of origin inside the Dolorian Church of Humanity in Martinaise, and appears to be under investigation by the Moralist International.[32]\n\nThe exact origins of the pale are unclear. Logical positivists claim the pale exists as pockets of anti-matter, capable of damaging and confusing the mind through extreme sensory deprivation. Dialectical materialists, on the other hand, say that it is composed of manifested information, or manifested past, capable of degrading memories into itself.[33] The Insulindian Phasmid, speaking to Harrier Du Bois, supports the later interpretation, referring to it as a \"human pollution\", and claiming that every animal and plant is scared of humanity for it, believing it will destroy them all.[34]"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Thank you for sharing this information with me about the Pale in the world of Disco Elysium.

Eight expeditions were sent out into the pale; five disappeared entirely, while two returned, but had lost their minds due to the effects of the pale. This is thought to have been a cruel attempt to purge the queen's political rivals, admirals who would have led the teams into the pale, which was thought to be inpenetrable.[4] However, the eighth and final expedition returned, and had managed to discover a new continent; Insulinde. At this time, Dolores Dei was councillor to the queen.[5]\n\nMundi is known as the \"Old Old World\".[6][7] In the Dolorian era, the three Crown Cities of the Mundi isola were Deora, Rheasilvia and Advesperascit.[8]\n\nGeography\nMundi is the largest of the seven isolas,[9] located to the north of Insulinde.[10] The majority of the nations on the isola are a part of the EPIS-aligned Occidental sub-continent,[11] and include the Republics[12] of Vesper,[13] Messina,[13] Oranje,[14] Sur-la-Clef,[15] Meteo,[16] K\u00f6nigstein,[17] Gottwald,[18][19] and the island of Ubi Sunt?.[20] The remaining non-Occidental nations include Kedra[21] (which has been a candidate member since '21),[22] Saramiriza,[13] Mesque,[13] and Sao.[13] During the Dolorian era, there were fourty Mondial nations, half of which rejected Dolores Dei's rule.[23]\n\nCorpus Mundi, a dormant volcano[24] holds the title of Elysium's highest point at 18.9 kilometres tall.[25] It is located on the Mundi isola, most likely in the Republic of Mesque. Mountaineer Cornelius Gurdi attempted to climb the mountain, but never returned,[26] though he is remembered as a national hero and is often associated with mountain goats -- the only creature fearless and agile enough to climb the mountain.[27]\n\nOccident\nThe Occident is a sub-continent[11] on the Mundi isola, located to the south of Kedra.[28] It consists of EPIS-aligned nations, with Sur-la-Clef as its \"executive heart\".[29] Notable geographic locations include Irmala, a plateau where the vast majority of the world's supply of cocaine is produced, typically by slave labour,[30] and the Staadskanaal, an artificial channel through the Occident that is connected to the Preto Grande.[31]\n\nVesper\nThe Republic of Vesper, formerly a part of the Republic of Vesper-Messina, is an Occidental nation[32] on the Mundi isola.[33] It is situated partially on a peninsula on the southeast of the Occident and is close in proximity to the pale.\n\nVesper is a constitutional monarchy,[32] and a member of the Moralintern as well as the Coalition of Nations.[34] Its Department of Justice has published a paper on criminal profiling in former socialist states.[35] Systems analysts from Vesper have analyzed and expressed worries about the collapse of the Revacholian Zone of Control.[36] Its coat of arms is a lion and ostrich sitting upright.[37]\n\nThe Harmon Wowshi W02 is manufactured in Vesper, but designed in Seol,[38] and Averro, SRL, a chain of high-end pharmacies is found only in Vesper and Messina.[39]\n\nThe Dick Mullen series, as well as its titular character are both Vespertine,[40] and the nation is generally known for its police and spy novels,[41] influencing the RCM's aesthetic and culture as a result.[42] The Antistar was a Vespertine rock star famous for shooting morphine into one eyeball, and cocaine into the other.[43] He would later die as a result of his drug use.[44]\n\nThe Franconigerian boiadero culture adopted by Call Me Ma\u00f1ana is an appropriation of \"Vespertine cool\".[45] Vespertine proto-expressionism is a major artistic movement from the last century.[46]\n\n\nMessina\nThe Republic of Messina, formerly the Republic of Vesper-Messina, was once a dual kingdom on the south-eastern coast of the Occident. It used to take up most of the peninsula, before separating into the Republics of Vesper and Messina. An amicable parting of ways produced two constitutional monarchies.\n\nMesque and Messina share a border.[47]\n\nOranje\nAn Oranje passport.\nThe Sovereign Republic of Oranje (O-RAN-yeh) or Oranjenrijk is a democratic nation on the Mundi isola, north of Insulinde, over the sea and across the pale.\n\nOranje is one of the six major Occidental nations to hold stake in the continued occupation of Revachol (the Coalition). People consider it a reasonable superpower.\n\nMuch of its influence is derived from its alignment with Moralintern and participation in EPIS, where it contributes 28% of the organization's annual budget and takes care of the political side of things. Next to Sur-la-Clef, Oranje is probably the most prominent member of the international community.[48]\n\nOranje's economy is one of the most advanced in the world. It has successfully transitioned from heavy industry to advanced services, and generally acts as an engine for sustainable change in the international community.\n\nNumerous customs are characteristic of Oranje. For example, the Oranjese Map of the Waterways. It is a sailor's tattoo worn by wayfarers of the Dolorian century, over 300 years ago. The sailors would mark their bodies to map their travels. As technology developed and evolved, the tattoo was slowly abandoned by sailors and adopted by mercenaries, as a way to showcase their military careers. Vredefort, the capital of the Oranjese state, is traditionally placed on the right shoulder as the origin point.\n\nIn some municipalities of Oranje, people do wear shoes made of wood to street parades. Green, orange, and even yellow tassels have also been seen on hats.\n\nLelystad municipality has few boroughs and even fewer cities \u2013 it's made of agricultural plots near the border of Gottwald. Executive summary: cows, silos, and wheat.[49]\nVredefort is the capital of Oranjenrijk, known for its parks, glass, duraluminium - a conference city.[50] It's known for its Ijsbrand Military Academy.[51]\nOranjese special forces are notorious for their prowess and lethality. Private military contractors are also common: One of the more infamous is the Corps de Pharmacie, a security firm contracted to protect the interests of Oranjese pharmaceutical companies in the Semenine conflict.\n\nGottwald and Oranje share a border.[52]\n\nSur-la-Clef\nSur-la-Clef, formerly known as the Kingdom of Suresne, is an Occidental country[53] on the Mundi isola. had a long and storied role in the history of the world. It is here that Innocence Dolores Dei came to power as the chief advisor to Queen Irene the Navigator[54]. Sur-La-Clef was also responsible for opening the Insulindian archipelago for colonization, three hundred years ago, and was the original owner of the city of Revachol. By the Current Century, it's a modern, urbanized country ranking high on the Human Development and Freedom index, a leading member of the Coalition, and the executive heart of EPIS.\n\nSur-la-Clef is one of the founding members of and hosts the headquarters of the major EPIS institutions. The nation focuses on the business side of things.[55]\n\nMeat balls and mashed potatoes are popular dishes in Sur-La-Clef. It's also popular in some parts of Revachol, primarily those with stronger ties to its original colonizing power.\n\nMeteo\nMeteo is a country on the Mundi isola.[56] It is one of the poorest first world nations today, but was once an ancient civilization.[57] Its capital city is Thylakos-by-Pisantic.[57] It is located near the Pisantic sea.[58]\n\nThe Meteoran name for the Founding Party is Ecclesiastes.[59]\n\nK\u00f6nigstein\nK\u00f6nigstein (lit. Kingstone) is a country on the Mundi isola.[60] It is located in the central Occident.[61] It is a rich country[62] known for it's contributions to psychology in the Thirties.[63] The Dominion Police of K\u00f6nigstein are a mounted police force known for their distinctive uniform of scarlet breeches and cylindrical fur caps.[61] Feld Electrical started as a midway electronics outfit in K\u00f6nigstein two centuries ago[64] and the now defunct lift company Halter was from K\u00f6nigstein.[65]\n\nK\u00f6nigstein is located in central Occident.\n\nGottwald\nGottwald is a nation on the Occidental subcontinent of the Mundi isola, bordering Oranje.[66]\n\nPeople from Gottwald are referred to as Gottwaldians or Gottwalders, or, derogatorily, Maun.[67] There is a Gottwaldian ambassador in Revachol.[68] Gottwald was a participant in the colonization of Iilmaraa.[69]\n\nThe language spoken in Gottwald is Walder. The accent is guttural and similar to an Oranjese accent.[70]\n\nGottwald is known for its industry. Companies and products from Gottwald include:\n\nSchneller, a fashionable stationary brand popular with architects and engineers[71]\nMauer-Koshlai Mercury Group, a Gottwaldian-Iilmaraan mercury extraction company[72]\nKristallsprach Model 9, a specialist radio transceiver[73]\nVilliers &amp; La Salle, one of the original 14 indotribes, was acquired by Gottwalders after the Revolution.[74]\n\nGottwald has a prestigious award for youth literature, the Kritikerpreis.[75]\n\nGottwald is the source of one of the two major strands of post-Revolution communist thought, the Gottwald School. Gottwaldian critical theory posits that intellectuals are a class incapable of performing revolutionary change, only capable of inspiring it in others through critique,[76] and is incompatible with infra-materialism.[77] They also seem to develop extensive psychological analysis.[78]\n\nA last-century Gottwaldian philosopher coined the term \u201clife-world,\u201d referring to things that share in human history.[79][80]\n\nKnut Schmelling and J\u00f6rgen Stirneman, legendary pinball players who have managed sub-twenty minute runs on Gurdi's Goats.[81]\nMoritz Metzger, a children's book author and illustrator who won the Kritikerpreis in '26 for his book The Saddest Pig in the World.[75]\nDr. Uwe Plattenkalk, an explorer and naturalist who claims to have sighted the eight-eyed teratorn in '21 while in Iilmaraa.[82]\nUbi Sunt?\n[83]\n\nMesque\nThe Republic of Mesque[84] is the world's largest state by territory.[85] Magritte is a river in the great steppes of northern Mesque.[86] Villalobos is a peninsula on Mesque.[87] The dormant shield volcano Corpus Mundi, that stands as the world's highest summit at 18.9 km, is likely located on Mundi given the name.[88]\n\n\nA rooster, commonly associated with Mesque.\n\nThe Confederate Republic of Mesque is a nation on the isola of Mundi. It is the world's largest state by territory. It is a confederation, petrostate, and a constitutional monarchy that has been experiencing a far-right shift in recent years, leading to isolation.[89]\n\nMesque has a long and complex history, tied closely to the Innocences. Franconegro, for example, is considered by many a father figure due to his militarism and nationalism. However, all things change: 300 years ago, the lands of Mesque and the Occident and even far-away Supramundi -- altogether twenty one of the forty Mondial nations of the time -- immediately accepted innocentic rule of Dolores Dei, even before her crowning. However, Dei's policies proved to be unpopular and eventually, the Mesque state tried to detach itself from innocentic rule. Parts of the world were experiencing whiplash from accelerating into secularism. Her mandatory education programs and mass resettlement of upstream Magritte were problematic as well. Dissenters were suppressed by a military force she called The Army of Humanity, leading to some modern thinkers condemning her treatment of Mesque reprehensible, and the many campaigns waged against it war crimes.[90][91][92]\n\nThe Mesque state seems to have reconciled its differences, as it was one of the members of the Coalition of Nations involved in pacifying the Antecentennial Revolution in Revachol. Occidental and Mesquite falangues - volunteers - were particularly infamous for their conduct in combat and bloodthirst.[93] To add insult to injury, the Mesque state was experiencing a golden age.[94] Fifty years on, Mesque is struggling: The golden age is over and the petrofascists are reigning supreme, isolating the nation on the interisolar stage.[95]\n\nMarietti is a Mesque style of music and dance commonly seen at all manner of festivities -- especially weddings. It's delightfully quaint, owing to its peasant origins.[96]\n\nCommon Mesque legends are tied to Cornelius Gurdi, and his attempt to scale the world's highest peak, Corpus Mundi. National legend claims that Gurdi will return when Mesque is in danger, in order to save his people.[97]\n\nKedra\nKedra is a large nation in the mid-northern area of the Mundi isola, north of the Occident, between the Irmalan mountain range and the Pisantic *mare interregnum*.[28] It is notable for Stepan the Despicable, who defeated and humiliated the false-innocence, Ern\u00f6 Pasternak.\n\nKedra is a candidate member of EPIS that has been negotiating for membership since '21. Some Moralintern members believe this warm, pleasant country known for its mandarin trees and Supramundi dust storms will never become a full member (at least as long as it remains an emerging market).\n\nKendra is known for its aquarelle-blue tile work.\n\nSaramiriza\nSaramiriza is a country on the Mundi isola.[98] Historically, Saramiriza acted as a vassal of the suzerainty of Revachol and provided Revachol with magenta cocaine.[99] Currently, Saramiriza is still associated with high-grade cocaine[100] and drug smuggling.[101] Also associated with Saramiriza is coffee[102] and communism.[103] The U41-A is the pale transport route from Saramiriza to Graad.[104]\n\nGeographically, Saramiriza and Supramundi appear related, being managed as one entity by the colonial powers of Revachol.[105] The nation also appears to have cultural and ethnic similarities with Mesque, in particular with regards to language and tattoos.[106] Under the Moralintern, Saramiriza is considered a hotbed for PMC wafare and gang conflict.[107]"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Thank you for sharing this additional information about the isola of Mundi in the world of Disco Elysium.

It is located west of the central landmass.[4]\n\nIt has maintained a level of distance from the other isolas for over a thousand years, rendering it inaccessible to other nations.[5] Because of this, it gained a reputation of exotic mystery, and the people of the Occident referred to it as the Shao Empire,[6] an unsavoury legend which still persists even in the modern day[7].\n\nDespite its isolation, Seol appears to have been exploited and possibly even colonized by Revachol during the time of the Suzerain, as decorations of Seolite rubies, melchiorite, and lapis lazuli are presente in the noble tombs of La Royaume.[8]\n\nDuring the Antecentennial Revolution, a number of Seolite officers in Revachol sided with the Suzerain, commandeering the royal navy.[9]\n\nIn modern times, Seol is one of the few nations not under the Moralintern's sphere of influence.[10] Its population is suggested to be around 1 billion people.[11]\n\nGeography\nSeol Cit\u00e9 may be the capital of Seol. Its temperature is not available to international broadcasting.[12]\n\nTechnology\nSeol is famous for having very advanced microtechnology, which serves as one of its primary exports.[13] The Harmon-Wowshi W02 tape recorder was designed in Seol.[14]\n\nCulture\nSeol is said to have very strict cultural norms, as well as a rigid class society and punitive justice system,[15] which have inspired a number of Seolites to leave and integrate into other nations. These migrations, however, end up being perceived as part of a 'Global Seolite Conspiracy' by certain fascists, who believe the Seolite Empire aims to conquer the world, physically and technologically.[16]\n\nOutside Seol, many alternative medical implements are marketed as 'Seolite' in order to appeal to perceptions of an ancient medicinal knowledge. These products include memory-improving tonics,[17] practices of traditional masters,[18] and \"hope catchers\".[19]\n\nSome people also perceive Seolites as being very dextrous and skilled at manual games, particularly pinball.[20] However, this is entirely unfounded.[15]\n\nThe Seolite \"Invisibles\" class is a course that teaches one how to traverse any environment in the most efficient way possible.[21]"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Thank you for providing information about the isola Seol.

It is located east of the central landmass.[1] The Wild Pines Group, as a royal monopoly company of Revachol the Suzerain, became the first to conduct trade between the two isolas. The company charted the newly found lands, and began exploitative trade relations that would develop into colonization.[2]\n\nDuring this time, the Safre Empire, which controlled most of the territories in Samara, became the target of a plan to create a captive market for the large amounts of cocaine Revachol was producing. The plan succeeded, leaving a large amount of the population addicted and in extreme poverty, relying on international aid even to the current day.[3]\n\nAt an uncertain point in time, the Safre Empire collapsed, presumably splitting into the current regions of Safre and South Safre. The Revacholian colonial holdings in Samara, which lasted until the Commune of Revachol, were concentrated in the Siigay archipelago. The province is commonly considered a backwater and unpleasant place to live, in part due to Revacholian colonialism. The name \"Apricot Suzerainty\", considered offensive, refers to how apricots were the primary colonial export of Siigay.[4]\n\nDuring the Antecentennial Revolution, the Hsin-Yao Commune was established, being the first manifestation of the revolution in Samara. Another state, the People's Republic of Samara, was founded as a socialist utopia after the collapse of the Mazovian government in Graad. While the Hsin-Yao Commune was extinguished in '06, Samara survived to '51.[5]\n\nEver since the year '39, a proxy war between Safre and Graad has been ongoing. The conflict became infamous for the involvement of Private Military Contractors, who committed numerous war crimes and atrocities in the village of Co Hoi, in South Safre.[6]\n\nIn the Samarskilt region, a small-scale civil war has been raging since '43, impeding tourism to Koko Nur.[7]\n\nLo Manthang underwent a decade-long war for independence, with complex causes. After a meeting between the head of the Samaran delegation and the diplomat Charles Villedrouin, relations with the Moralist International were normalized.[8]\n\nThe industrialized regions of South Safre, Hsin-Yao and Siigay are known for large chemical factories, which produce and export raw ingredients for medicine and drugs. A significant amount of these ingredients are delivered to Martinaise's Terminal B, then fed into the Dockworkers' Union drug trade.[9]\n\nIn the Current Century, anti-government sentiment has become increasingly popular among the religious youth, who consider the Seraise government oppressive and too influenced by Occidental ways of life. One particularly notorious form of protest is self-immolation.[10]\n\nA number of nations in Samara are considered to be outside the Moralintern's sphere of influence.[11]\n\nGeography\nThe primary nations on Samara appear to be Safre (once the Safre Empire and sometimes referred to as the Seraise Empire),[12] South Safre, Samarskilt AR, the isle of Lo Manthang, and the People's Republic of Samara (SRV).\n\nThe Siigay archipelago is a province of Safre. Co Hoi is a village in South Safre. Hsin-Yao is located in Southeast Samara.[13]\n\nThe Koko Nur desert is a specific area of the Samarskilt region, known for being very arid. In folklore and cryptozoology, it is said to be inhabited by the Giant of Koko Nur, a titanic luminous being,[14] speculated to grow so large due to a gravity anomaly under the desert.[15]\n\nEcology\nThe Seraise Fern is a potted plant present in the Whirling-in-Rags. It is said to grow in both Safre and South Safre.[16]\n\nThe Seraise Giant Hornet is the world's largest insect. It can kill forty honey bees a minute. A group of thirty can decimate an entire hive of 20.000 bees in less than four hours.[17]\n\nCulture\nIn ancient times, Samaran tribes would carve boulders of rhodochrosite to represent their wealth, with the size of the boulder being proportional to that of the fortune.[18]\n\nSam Bo or Samaran boxing is an eloquently violent set of one-on-one fighting moves practised to perfection. while Sambo incorporates a wide array of martial disciplines from archery to mounted combat, outside of Samara the term is used to refer to any fighting style that implies stealth, cleverness, and cool.[19]\n\nThe isle of Lo Manthang originated a martial art known as Lo Manthang stick fighting.[20] The practice has a great amount of cultural variations, based on what wood the stick is carved from, such as the sacred Mabolo tradition of the Hali people, who carve the sticks from butterfruit tree wood.[21] Lo Manthang sticks are also used in a special technique for climbing battlements.[22]\n\nGoat milk butter is a staple food of Samara. The Samaran terrain makes it easier to raise goats than cows, and the local goat farmers produce high-quality meat and dairy staples that are one of the isola's primary exports.[23] A sign advertising \"Samaran Butter\" is present in Martinaise, over the inlet canal.\n\nThe region of Safre Serai is said to be home to a creature known as the \"burning rhino\", a rhinoceros with the ability to set itself ablaze during nighttime.[24] In truth, the creature is a hoax, and was fabricated by locals setting rhino cadavers on fire to scare tourists.[25]\n\n\"Surrender to the Night\" is the name of a traditional children's lullaby, passed down across generations. It is considered somewhat grim.[26]\n\nGeography\nPeople's Republic of Samara\nThe People's Republic of Samara or SRV is a state founded as a \"socialist utopia\" by evacuees from the collapsing Mazovian government in Graad. Although the country is the only still surviving socialist state from the revolution, it is considered to have degenerated from its founding ideals. It has degenerated into a bureaucratic workers' state- in no small part due to the decades-long rule of President Sapormat 'Sport' Knezhinisky[27] As an example, the SRV has been cooperating with various Moralintern initiatives, such as HUMANOX, sending humanitarian aid to Revachol.\n\nIgnus Nilsen, from Vaasa[28] and Kraz Mazov's most trusted lieutenant, helped establish the People's Republic of Samara circa '06. Nilsen is often cited as the second most important figure in the Antecentennial Revolution, following Kraz Mazov, and is called the \"Evangelist of the Revolution\" by admirers.[29][30]\n\nNilsen is well known for both his war crimes and Nilsenist-Mazovianism.[30] During the communists' retreat from Graad to Samara, he personally ordered up to 12,000 prisoners of war to be impaled on sharpened spruce trees in the Samaran backcountry. From then on, he was known as the \"Apocalyptic Shrike\" by his enemies.[31] Nilsen also pioneered infra-materialism.[30]\n\nIn '51, the SRV embarked on an ambitious public fitness initiative, devised by President Knezhinisky: Bear wrestling. Man-on-bear wrestling competition, one-on-one, five rounds or until incapacitation. The official line is that public support stands at 87%, youth obesity and alcoholism are down at 12% and 7% respectively.\n\nSafre\nIn the time of the Revacholian suzerainty, in the middle of the last century, Safre became the victim of a lucrative trade campaign. The suzerain introduced cocaine into the territory, creating an extremely valuable and captive market for an extremely addictive product. The widespread addiction caused productivity to plummet, and fully half of the former Safre Empire remains dependent on international aid in exchange for a steady supply of cheap produce, apricots.[32][33]\n\nThe Antecentennial Revolution metastasized to Safre, the third great region hit by it. It was extinguished in '06. As of the present, Graad is engaged in the Tien-En conflict, a proxy war with Safre. It has been hot for 12 years, since '39, with atrocities piling up daily. Mostly committed by Graad. Co Hoi is a village that was the site of infamous war crimes and its name entered common parlance as a term for atrocities.\n\nHsin-Yao\nHsin-Yao is a region where a communist state formed, the Hsin-Yao Commune. During the Revolution, it provided military aid to communards across the isolas, most notably Revachol, where the Triangong 4-46 became a highly sought-after rifle, thanks to it being reliably bad and thus suitable for long-term use.\n\nThe Hsin-Yao Commune was a third metastasis of the World Revolution. The Commune supplied the communists in Revachol and Graad with military aid, particularly the mass-produced Triangong 4.46 sniper rifle.[34] The official anthem of the Commune was \"Boy with a Scythe / Golden Sun\".[35] The Commune was extinguished in '06, and largely forgotten.[36]\n\nSiigay\nKoko Nur\nLo Manthang\nLo Manthang underwent a decade-long war for independence, with complex causes.

In Graad, this led to Funk music, an agressive and guitar-oriented resurgence of The New-era Disco.[2] In Insulinde, migrant Iilmaraan workers were brought to build the city of Revachol,[3] 380 years before the Current Century.[4] Semenine is inhabited mostly by people of Areopagite descent, with some speculating that ancient Iilmaraans came to the islands over 4.000 years ago.[5]\n\nAfter being discovered, Iilmaraa was rapidly colonized, largely by Mesque.[6] Revachol later acquired a colony in Tioumoutiri, focused on tobacco production.[7] The Iilmaraan natives had their land stolen, as well as many of their historical artifacts, which were relocated to museums in Revachol, Gottwald, and Sur-la-Clef.[8] Despite the extensive colonization, however, Iilmaraa is still an industrial powerhouse.[9]\n\nEcology\nSongbirds inhabit the Ea mountain range, producing sounds that are outside the range of human hearing.

The uprising was inspired by the Graadian authorities' inabilities to contain a pandemic of tzaraath, a deadly prion disease. Kras Mazov, economic theoretician and leader of the Communist Party of Shest and Graad, overthrew the government, establishing the Graadian socialist state.\n\nThe Mazovian government lasted 6 years, collapsing after a counter-revolutionary movement in '08. As the State Day Palace in Mirova was surrounded, Mazov is said to have committed suicide. However, this claim is disputed.[2]\n\nAfter the fall of the Revolution in Graad, it was quickly restored back into the moralist world order, becoming a member of the Coalition of Nations and participating in the invasion of Revachol.[3] The Suzerain of Revachol, an exile, managed to live the rest of his life as a venture capitalist in Graad.[4]\n\nIn the '20s, a brief period of economic liberalization in Yugo-Graad took place, being known as the Yugo-Graad Spring. The project backfired, resulting in widespread poverty. This poverty, coupled with ethnic unrest and the state's repressive tactics, led to a civil uprising known as the Yugo-Graad Riots, which took place from '27 to '29.

Despite this, the Queen of Suresne Irene La Navigateur sent eight expeditions into the pale[10] on the advice of Dolores Dei.[11] It is implied that these expeditions served a dual purpose to give Irene La Navigateur a way to purge her political rivals who would be serving as admirals on the expeditions.[12]\n\nThe eighth of these expeditions returned, sane and intact, and reported to Irene La Navigateur and Dolores Dei of the new continent of matter they had discovered.[13] They reported that the pale had begun to condense until it had formed a vast ocean. The crew at the time thought they were hallucinating. The mast-hand proclaimed 'L\u00b4Insulinde! L\u00b4Insulinde!' \u2013 the signal to wake up.[14] However, they were awake. Soon islands began to appear on the horizon. When returning to Irene La Navigateur and Dolores Dei, they summarized their experiences as 'Apr\u00e8s la vie, la mort, Apr\u00e8s la mort, la vie encore! Apr\u00e8s le monde, le gris. Apr\u00e8s le gris, le monde encore!'.[15] (After life, death. After death, life again! After the world, the grey [pale]. After the grey, the world again!)\n\nDuring this time, around 380 years ago, settlers from the Occident began to colonize Insulinde.[16]\n\nRevacholian Suzerainty\nAt some point after the early days of settling the archipelago, Revachol achieved independence from the Kingdom of Suresne.[17] It became governed by a constitutional monarchy.[18] During this period Revachol became the capital of the world.[19]\n\nEcology\nA wide variety of plants and animals are found on the Insulindian isola.\n\nAnimals that exist on the Insulindian isola include tigers,[20] monotremes, megabats,[21] wolves, dogs,[22] cats,[23] rats,[24] horses,[25], cockatoos,[26] gulls, and skuas.[27]\n\nPlants that exist on the Insulindian isola include carrion flowers, mangrove trees,[21] evergreen trees,[22] oak trees,[25] birch trees,[28] hawthorn trees,[29] blood beech trees,[30] and may bells.[31]\n\nIn addition to the confirmed animals on the Insulindian isola, there are some unconfirmed cryptids on the isola. The Nnong Okk is an owl cryptid rumored to exist on the Semenine Islands.[32] The Insulindian Phasmid is thought to be a cryptid, but can be discovered through the course of the game by Harrier Du Bois.[33] It is also possible that the Col Do Ma Ma Daqua migrated to the isola, settling near Martinaise.[34]\n\nPolitics\nCurrently, Insulinde has many countries and regions each with their own politics.\n\nThe Parti communiste d'Insulinde appears to have been an isola-wide political party during the time of the Revolution.[35]\n\nThe Free State of Semenine is involved in a new round of free-trade negotiations with EPIS nations.[36]\n\nCulture\nThe great Skua is the symbol for the discovery of the Insulidian isola.[37]\n\nGeography\nInsulinde is home to the world\u2019s largest body of water, the Insulindic Ocean.[38] Early Revacholians called it \u201cles Immensit\u00e9s Bleues\u201d or The Blue Immensities.

The pale exists further away in the south, east, and west.[42] It is the fourth largest island in the world.[43] On its north coast, built around the vast delta of the river Esperance,[44] is the city of Revachol.[45] Revachol has a radius of 80 kilometres.[46] To the east of the Esperance are rolling hillsides.[47] The Bay of Revachol has a depth of up to 1200 meters,[48] and feeds into the Insulindic ocean.[49]\n\nJust off the southwest coast of Le Caillou is the island of Laurentide.[50] Deora-of-the-Seven-Seas is a major city on the island.[45] The island groups of Ozonne and Face-\u00e0-La-Mer neighbor Le Caillou.[43] Ozonne is 80 kilometres[51] and two day's travel from Revachol.[52] The cities of Fond de l'Air and Virmandeux are on Ozonne.[45]\n\nBetancourt is a location twenty kilometres from Martinaise.[53]\n\nThe Semenese Islands (also called \u00cele du Fant\u00f4me) are in the southwest of Insulinde.[54] Banatial is one of the inhabited Semenese archipelagos near the pale and covered in jungle.[55] Olduvai,[45] Casherbrume,[56] and Ulunbuir are all cities on the Semenine Islands.[57]\n\nCroyant-Morain and Villiers are located on Archipelagos.[45]\n\nR\u00e9surrection is an island way beyond Martinaise.[58]\n\nSereglee is the southernmost island in the Seminine archipelago and borders the pale.[59] The North Arcade Islands[60] and the Near Pale Offshore Platform \u2018Insulindico\u2019 also border the pale in Insulinde.[61]\n\nLe Caillou\nMain article: Revachol.\n\nSemenese Islands\nThe Free State of Semenine (also called Ile du Fant\u00f4me) is a country located on the edge of the Insulindian isola.[43]\n\nThe Semenine Islands are inhabited by the Semenese who are descendants of the Aeropagites of ancient Perikarnassis who arrived on the Insulindian isola 4000 years ago.[62]\n\nThe Suzerain of Revachol colonized the Semenine Islands and used it as a vassal for the production of sugar.[63]\n\nThe Semenese conflict began in \u201942.[64] A proxy war was held on the Semenese islands over the island's territory. One faction, the Semenese nationalists had Banaital as their anchor point.[45] The opposition was, in part, Corps de Pharmacie a security firm created to protect the business interests of Oranjese pharmaceutical companies.[65] In '41, war crimes were committed on Banaital by Krenel mercenaries.[66]\n\nSemenine is to the southwest of Le Caillou and Revachol in the Insulindic ocean.[67]\n\nBanaital is one of the inhabited islands of the Semenese archipelago, near the pale. It is covered in jungle.[45] It has a monsoon season.[68] Olduvai is a city on the Semenine Islands.[69] Casherbrume (also known as Ile-de-Casherbrume) is another city on the Semenine Islands.[43] Ulunbuir is another city on the Semenese archipelago.[21] Sereglee is the southernmost island of the archipelago,[70] and borders the pale.[71]\n\nThe bang-bang cockatoo is a shy cockatoo with mostly grey and white cockatoo found in almost all Semenese forests. Its Semenese name is thought to be onomatopoeic in origins.[72] Other plants and animals found in the Semenine Islands are tigers,[73] monotremes, megabats, mangrove trees, and carrion flowers.[74]\n\nThe Nnong Okk is a cryptid supposedly found on the Semenine Islands. It is supposedly a flightless cursor owl with long legs that allow it to run faster than any avian and possibly any other animal.[75] When it is not hunting prey by running, it supposedly hangs upside down from tree branches like a bat waiting to dive onto prey on the jungle floor.[76]\n\nThe Semenese Islands are a conflict corridor. They do not have a good record of reporting atrocious military conduct committed on their soil.[77]\n\nCasherbrume serves as a tax haven in which shell companies are registered.[78]\n\nCurrently, the Free State of Semenine is involved in another round of free trade negotiations with EPIS nations.[79]\n\nThe Semenine Islands are a beautiful place with a rich and unique culture.[80] However, much of the information presented on the Semenese and the Semenine Islands in the game is told through biased sources. The Semenese in Revachol are a racial minority and experience racism.[81] Characters will present racist pseudo-histories, such as digital mutilation among the Semenese, as fact.[82] As such, it is possible and likely that actual Semenese culture and beliefs are different than how they are presented in game.\n\nA traditional Semenese ward is a charm shaped like an irregular polyhedron, assembled from bones, sticks, and straws that contains a fish head.[83] It is meant to provide protection against ill luck, bad dreams, curses, and other supra-natural scourges.[84]\n\nA belief among Semenese people is that pale exposure can lead to immaculate conception.[21]\n\nOzonne\nOzonne is an archipelago located in Insulinde, to the north of Le Caillou.\n\nAn archipelago located in Insulinde, to the north of Le Caillou, Ozonne is a posh, wealthy region with expensive boutiques and restaurants.

However, in her early twenties, Joyce visited Jamrock with girlfriends from Ozonne, having a \"brief dalliance\" with a broad-shouldered man from the area.[86][87][88]\n\nAfter the collapse of the Antecentennial Revolution, Ozonne became the site of mass graves for dead communards and anarchists.[89] The bodies of revolutionary leaders Julia Dobreva and Jean Abadanaiz were later found there, having apparently committed suicide by poisoning.[90]\n\nLaurentide\nLaurentide is a location in Disco Elysium on the Insulindian isola.[91]\n\nIt is an island located on the other end of Le Caillou off the mainland,[92] its major city is Deora-of-the-Seven-Seas.[93]\n\nFace-a-la-Mer\nArchipelagos\nArchipelagos is a location in Disco Elysium on the Insulindian isola.[94]\n\nCroyant-Morain is a major city in this region.[95] It is implied to be a a very wealthy city.[96] Villiers is another major city in the region.]"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Thank you for providing this information about the fictional world of Disco Elysium.

I hope she loves me too.\"\n\nBorn in the year '23 in Oranje, Katarzine Alasije was the daughter of Zsiemsk immigrants from Graad, though naturalized Oranjese.[7] At the age of 14, she won the Miss Teen Oranje beauty-pageant, a competition that was later discontinued.[8] She claims it was her immigrant descent and appearance that attracted attention in the competition.[9] Throughout her youth, she claims to have worked a variety of jobs, including as a secretary and roller skating instructor.[10] Her victory at the competition would also get her a scholarship for studying Oranjese literature.[11] In university, she also met a boy, a writer of Oranjese lit, who became her first boyfriend and gave her the nickname \"Klaasje\".[12]\n\nOne of her jobs that she performed well at was as an insurance seller, which brought her to the attention of a large banking firm.[13] Her new job as \"competitive intelligence\" finally brought her stability, and became her main focus. The first job performed for her employers was the infiltration of a small printing company, which was so successful she was called for another.[14] However, her work also resulted in several people losing their jobs and livelihoods,[15] and at least one person committed suicide due to this.[16] Her connections also affected her boyfriend, who never recovered.[12]\n\nThe second job was against the Loosduin County Savings Bank, a subsidiary of a large coporate conglomerate named Looskap, with ties to the Moralist International and massive, destructive economic influence over second world countries.[17] After the completion of her objectives, Klaasje feared that her employers would attempt to get rid of her, and fled instead of attending their rendezvous.[18] Using falsified documents that her employer had given her, with the name \"Annouk Meijer-Smit\", Klaasje took a flight to Revachol.[19] Her bags contained tickets for Villiers and then Casherbrume, on the Free State of Semenine, in order to hide at the edge of the Pale.[20]\n\nUpon arriving, Klaasje booked a room in the Whirling-in-Rags and hid her documents inside a hollowed-out buoy, floating in the Martinaise Inlet. Then, she engaged in an intense regimen of partying, sex, drugs, booze, and karaoke. She amassed quite the collection of drugs, including NACRA (an opioid receptor antagonist for dealing with overdoses) and plenty of of Preptide, Saint Batiste's proprietary amphetamine. Her documents were later taken by the Insulindian Phasmid.[21] Despite her hiding, however, Klaasje continued to live in fear of persecution from both her employers and Looskap,[22] though neither would actually find her there.\n\nRelationship With The Deceased\nInstead, her presence attracted the attention of Iosef Lilianovich Dros, who watched her from his sniper's nest in the Sea Fortress, and developed a psychosexual obsession.\n\nProvoked to kill by Klaasje and Lely's relationship, Dros shot and killed him through the window of her hostel room while the two were having sex. Fearing that the bullet was from a corporate assassin meant for her,[23] Klaasje set out to cover up the crime, manipulating Ruby and Titus Hardie into staging a hanging so that the RCM would investigate, believing it to be a murder tied to the ongoing strike.\n\nShe disguised her voice by nicking the telephone wire with a pair of nail scissors before calling in to report the supposed hanging[24] because she was afraid of the repercussions if it was discovered that she had phoned the RCM.\n\nInteractions\nKlaasje is the first character available to be interacted with, though passing by without talking to her on the first day may make a later Red Check easier.

Traditionally, an innocence, when anointed, assumes supreme rule over the Occident, or the known world in general.[1] An innocence is elected to office by the Founding Party, a precedent that has taken place a mere six times in the entirety of History. The legal system of the Re\u00e1l Belt is built from ground up to accommodate innoccentic rule.[2] Innocents are quasi-theocratic in nature - churches are built as places of worship to their lives and ideals and are seen as capable of performing miracles.\n\nAccording to the Party, an innocence is infallible. The decisions made by one are not decisions. They are inevitabilities -- what would have happened anyway, only accelerated, packed into decades instead of centuries. An Innocence is a continuous, compressed event, a sacred human being. They say it is an honour and a glory to live when one is in office.[3] Commonly an innocence does not enforce his or her power through military power. This is seen as unnecessary. The innocence wins because an innocence can't help but win.[4]\n\nKnown Innocences\nOnly six Innocences appeared in the history of the world:\n\nThe Perikarnassian, the first innocence. Little is known about him.\nFranconegro, 500 years before Current Century. Considered to be the the innocence of militarism and the strongest of them all in military terms.\nDolores Dei, 300 years before Current Century. She originated many modern institutions, launched several successful expeditions, and was even critical of the innocentic system itself. She is also known for her beauty and inhumanity. Dolores Dei has become widely regarded as the greatest innocence in the current century.\nSola, crowned during the last century. Considered to be an anti-innocence, due to her reluctance to impose her will on the world.\nThere have also been a number of counter- or false-innocences -- some assumed to have innocentic qualities, some who just thought so themselves. Occasionally they have the support of a faction inside the ecclesiastic organization.[5] The most famous -- and important -- of these was Ern\u00f6 Pasternak. He was known for torture, despotism, hymns, cannons, and desires of world conquest, but got defeated and humiliated by Stepan the Despicable of Kedra.[6]"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "It is worth noting that the concept of innocence is highly controversial and has been the subject of much debate and criticism within the game's world.

They also invented god; and the equality of men before god.[3]\n\nAs the first Innocence, they declared that there should be more of those like them. It is presumed their disciples were the beginning of the Founding Party, which was then known as the Holy Party.[4] The followers of the Perikarnassian would go on to found the Perikarnassian church, utilizing the Star of Perikarnassis, or Chi-Rho, as its symbol: \"a great moral height to be strived towards\".[5] The Perkinassians were also known for their theories about love as a link to immortality,[6] and, 2,000 years later, would be the first to study the Pale, then known as the Western Plain.[7]"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "It is also worth noting that the Perikarnassian's rule is considered the beginning of the \"Current Century\", which is the current era in the world of Disco Elysium.

She is the most well known Innocence, and the figurehead of Dolorianism.\n\nHair Color: White\nEye Color: Light blue, flecked with green\n\nBackground\nDolores ruled three hundred years ago, in the wake of the discovery of the Insulindian isola by explorers from the continent of Mundi. She is, among other things, the innocence of interisolary travel and the connected world. She was a woman of the court, the wife of an influential *marchese*, and eventually the principal advisor to Irene La Navigateur, Queen of Suresne (modern day Sur-la-Clef). She was also gorgeous beyond beauty. Terribly. Women of the court at that time were expected to be the intellectual equals of any man. They were expected to play both chess and contract bridge at the highest levels, in addition to demonstrating aptitude in matters of philosophy, theology, and science... She made the most of her position in the Antedolorian court -- a court visited by the most prominent thinkers and artists of the day. In secret, she was becoming the era's pre-eminent philosopher of the state. A scalpel, a piercing gaze... She was an almost preternaturally magnetic and intelligent individual. To her contemporaries she appeared out of time, a messenger from the future of the species. We *all* fell in love with her, head over heels. Even before she was declared Her Innocence her influence was tremendous.\n\nIt was on her advice that Irene La Navigateur sponsored a number of voyages into the pale. A costly, often tragic endeavour, ultimately vindicated by the discovery of the *New New World*, the piece of reality you're standing on.\n\nAs did we all. The lands of Mesque and the Occident and even far-away Supramundi -- altogether twenty one of the forty Mondial nations of the time -- immediately accepted innocentic rule. Even before her crowning. In a city called Advesperascit, in Vesper-Messina, her homeland. The name of the city means \"Evening comes,\" but it happened on a winter's morning with the canals frozen and slush falling out of the sky. When her innocence was declared -- and the queen she had advised for years fell on her knees before her -- she was so overcome with emotion that her *lungs* started *glowing* in her chest. That is why the lungs are the symbol of love for the cultures of the Real Belt.\n\nShe was insultingly beautiful. She was humanity's young mother, a perfect mother. It was as if her face and shoulders and hands were covered in a soft down of under-feathers. You know this well -- very well. Yes. In a city called Advesperascit, in Vesper-Messina, her homeland. The name of the city means \"Evening comes,\" but it happened on a winter's morning with the canals frozen and slush falling out of the sky. She was dressed in a white and pearl dress on an emptied-out plaza, with the crowd far away. Already her Therriers -- the secret servicemen of the innocence -- were worried about an assassination attempt. Midwinter snow was beating the cobblestones around her. A small attache of officials stood by as her Therriers placed a white gold wreath on her head. The crowning mostly witnessed by secret servicemen.\n\nOne of the men in this secret service killed her -- 22 years later. A young man who had come to suspect that Dolores Dei was not entirely human, but something else. Dolores Dei was shot in the chest with a fowling piece. The man, thought to be insane, said he once touched her and her body had been unnaturally warm, like furnace -- and that sometimes while on duty he observed her forgetting to breathe for over ten minutes... Something that had walked in our midst, watching us stumble for hundreds, if not thousands of years, until it decided to interfere -- interfere in the course of our history. \"We were supposed to come up with this ourselves!\" the man was reported to have screamed at the innocence... This *inhuman* quality was witnessed by many others as well -- glowing lungs and all. It is commonly attributed to mass hysteria and religious psychology.\n\nSubtle terror\nAlthough she is often considered to be the greatest human being to ever live, there *was* something ominous about Dolores Dei -- constantly surrounded by her Therriers... She adored chess, yes -- but also military war games. Dolores Dei often holds a tiny tin soldier between her index finger and thumb -- in icons such as this. She was also blonde, the blondest woman you have ever seen, with green eyes the colour of the Pisantic *mare interregnum*... She was the most socially secluded and least self-aware of all the innocences. Some modern thinkers would consider her a war criminal for the campaigns she waged against the Mesque state. And then there were the resettlement programs... The Mesque state tried to detach itself from innocentic rule. Parts of the world were experiencing whiplash from accelerating into secularism. Her mandatory education programs and mass resettlement of upstream Magritte were problematic as well. Dissenters were suppressed by a military force she called \"The Army of Humanity.\" Little is known of her marchese husband. It's as if he vanished from history after completing his role -- which was to introduce Dolores Dei to court. In conclusion, yes, there *is* something lonely, paranoid, and even terrifying that people seldom mention, but *feel* when they think of her...\n\nInteractions\nDolores Dei appears in the final dream sequence after sleeping on the Sea Fortress island, mixed together with the memory of Dora Ingerlund.\nThe dream only occurs if the church is entered and the stained-glass window of Dolores Dei is seen; otherwise, an alternative skills-based scene plays.\nEtymology\n\"Dolores Dei\" translates from Latin as \"The Sorrows of God\""}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Sola is a character in Disco Elysium.

Scientific studies utilizing weather balloons from the ORG nations (Occident-Revachol-Graad) have begun to piece together something resembling a \"dark grey corona,\" as opposed to the sphere shape the world was presumed to be.[4]\n\nHistory\nPerikarnassis\nPerikarnassis is repeatedly cited as the oldest known ancient civilization, located on the \"super-isola\" of Perikarnassis.[5][6][7][8] Since the Perikarnassis Incident, or their fall, there has been nearly 8,000 years of recorded history.[9] It is unclear what exactly caused this incident; but it is implied that the pale was involved.\n\nThe Innocences\nFrom this point forward, the known history of Elysium is heavily centered on the innocences. Not much is known about the isolas outside of innocentic influence, including Seol: an isolationist panisolary west of the Insulinde.[10] There are six elected innocences,[11] though only four legitimate ones are known: Pius, the First Innocence; Franconegro, the innocence of militarism; Dolores Dei, the innocence of interisolary travel; and Sola, the anti-innocence.\n\nPius and Franconegro\n500 years ago, Franconegro was coronated in an unspecified isola, starting the approximately two centuries of the Franconigerian period.[12][13] Franconegro gave \"The Perikarnassian,\" the first innocence, the name of Pius.[14]\n\nNot much is known about Pius (even his gender is ambiguous), but he is often depicted as a young man with molten gold pouring out of his mouth. Some claim he invented god and equality of men before god, and he also introduced the gold standard. It is presumed that his disciples were the beginning of the Holy Party, also known as the Founding Party.[14] To this day, the Holy Party seeks out the re-emergence of the innocence.[15]\n\nFranconegro implemented re\u00e1l as the unified currency, codified hereditary rule, ended serfdom, and invented the concept of the Nation.[16] Franconigerian troops wore lamellar and carried flintlock guns,[17] and the heavy calvary was known for being very wide.[18] The Mesque see him as the father of nations due to his militarism and nationalism.[19]\n\nAt one point of his reign, Franconegro attempted to solve rising tensions between the aristocracy and bourgeoisie by building a unified society, in which every man could rise to nobility based on \"virtue.\"[20]\n\nTrains existed in the Franconigerian era.[21]\n\nDolores Dei\n\nStained glass portrait of Dolores Dei and Irene La Navigateur below her\n\n300 years ago,[22] Dolores Dei was introduced to Queen Irene La Navigateur's Suresne court[23] by way of her husband, an influential marchese.[24] Like other women of the court, she was expected to play both contract bridge and chess well enough, and to have a decent enough education, to be entertaining to the men. Compared to others, however, she was exceptionally charming and smart. She learned much from the court, which solicited great thinkers and artists, and amassed much influence even before she became an innocence, eventually becoming the queen's primary advisor.[25][24]\n\nUnder her advice, Irene La Navigateur sponsored numerous costly voyages into the pale, which eventually led to the discovery of the Insulindian isola, or the \"New New World.\" Two years after the first successful voyage, she was crowned as the new innocence.[25]\n\nAt her coronation in Advesperascit, her homeland located in Vesper-Messina,[26] it is said that her lungs began glowing from love.[23][27] Thus began the Dolorian Era: widely considered to be the golden age for humanity.\n\nDeora, Rheasilvia, and Advesperascit were the three \"Crown Cities\" of the Dolorian era. It is implied that airships existed at this time.[28]\n\nDolores Dei was an innocence of humanism, internationalism, three scientific revolutions, balance of terror theory, and the welfare state.[29] She codified parliamentary democracy and created institutions, including Moralist International, or the Moralintern.[30]\n\nModern critics point to her campaigns against the Mesque state, which tried to detached itself from innocent/secular rule, and the resettlement programs of upstream Magritte. She suppressed dissenters with a military force called \"The Army of Humanity.\"[31]\n\nDolores Dei kept a secret service called \"Therriers\" that protected her safety.[26] 22 years after her coronation, she was killed by one of the Therriers who suspected she was not entirely human. He is reported to have screamed \"We were supposed to come up with this ourselves!\" before shooting her eight times in the chest.[32]\n\nHer legacy is the Moralintern, which was founded by many of the same Founding Party members that elected Dolores Dei as innocence. Other Founding Party members also moved to Sur-la-Clef and proceeded to invent modern corporate finance.[33]\n\nHer colors are silver, white, and apricot.[34]\n\nSola\nSola was anointed within the previous century and even lived to see the current one. She was an urban planner who spoke her mind, encouraging people to excel on their own. As such, she is often called an \"anti-innocence.\" She resigned after an assassination attempt by a Yugo nationalist, who blamed her for not taking the side of the left during the Antecentennial Revolution.[35]\n\nAntecentennial Revolution\n\nCommunist Anarchist Flag\n\nThe Antecentennial Revolution, also known as the Turn-Of-The-Century Revolution[36] or World Revolution,[37] was a series of interisolary conflicts primarily between the Communists, known as the Communards, and the Moralintern and royalty. It began in Graad, in '02,[38] sparked in part by a virulent prion pandemic, called \"tzaraath\"[39] and Kraz Mazov.[40]\n\nThe Revolution was crushed by the Coalition. In '08, Graad's Eleven Day Government was overthrown.[41] The Commune of Revachol ends with the signing of the Revacholian Instrument of Surrender in '10[41][42] following Operation Death Blow: the bombing of Martinaise, Stella Maris, and the Delta.[43] However, the Suzerainty of Revachol was dissolved by the communists with the death of Frissel the First.[44][45]\n\n40 million people died in the revolution. By the end, nearly all communists and anarchists were wiped out by Coalition forces.[46] Before that, however, communists and anarchists killed two million people within the Insulinde, and Joyce Messier claims that Mazovianism led to the deaths of fifteen million people in Graad.[47]\n\nModern Elysium\nBy '51, there are 3.6 billion people plus an unspecified number of Seol citizens in the world.[48] One line suggests that the total population is 4.6 billion.[49]\n\nAreas such as Supramundi, Yeesut, the Semenese Islands, and Saramiriza are centers of proxy wars.[50][51] Of note is Co Hoi, a South Safre village wherein numerous atrocities are commited daily, mostly by Graad in its proxy war against Safre.[52] Private military contractors like Krenel operate in these areas, furthering corporate interests.[51]\n\nThe Moralintern, in association with the Coalition of Nations, acts as the leading international organization, easing diplomatic relations between countries, establishing trade and commerce, and managing the development of post-revolutionary states and poor nations. All of this is done through a series of complicated systems and subsidiary organizations, including EPIS and the International Collaboration Police.\n\nHarry Du Bois, informed by Shivers, predicts that in 22 years, Revachol will be leveled by an atomic device.[53]"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Thank you for providing additional information on the lore of Disco Elysium.

The place went bust around '88, the last time the elevator was ever maintained.\n\nPoints of interest\nIt features a hall with tables, pinball machines (including a Royal Pinball), a small stage and a bar, a kitchen, a Union reunion room, and three bedrooms for rent. Most of its customers are dockworkers.\n\nUpstairs\nThere are three guest rooms upstairs, with you waking up in room #1 at the start of the game, ruined beyond recognition. Your clothes are scattered all over, the stereo is destroyed, and there's a ton of tare throughout plus a broken window that you can use Visual Calculus (Easy 9) on to assess the damage. In the foul-smelling bathroom is a faucet and a mirror that you can use to remove the Expression (that ugly grin) with an Electrochemistry check (Impossible 18) or use Encyclopedia (Formidable 13) to unlock the Guillaume le Million thought. Leaving the room requires finding the key in your pants pocket.\nBy knowing about Ostentatious Orchestrations a +1 modifier will be applied when attempting to complete a White Encyclopedia Check to find the source of the Expression. Passing the previous Electrochemistry check will earn an additional +2 modifier to remove the Expression after learning of its origin.\nShaving Harry's moustache in the Coastal Shack (Day 3+) will award a positive modifier while passing the Electrochemistry check.\nThe room is one of two houses available in the game, but it requires paying \u2724 20.00 each day until you resolve the mercenary tribunal. At that point, Garte will clean up the room and let you rest for free.\nThe center room belongs to Kim Kitsuragi. It's not accessible until after the Tribunal.\nThe right room belongs to Klaasje and is a double-decker. Downstairs is the bathroom and writing desk, while upstairs is the bedroom, Klaasje herself, and an entrance to the abandoned workshop.\nThe upper floor corridor leads to the outer balcony, where you can find the other shoe, go debrief with Kim, or collect \u2724 0.40 from the counter. The radio will list weather forecasts for Elysium.\nGround floor\nThe largest area of Whirling, housing the mess hall, the box for Union workers (reserved for use by Hardie boys), counter, kitchen, and karaoke stage. Lawrence Garte tends to the counter, trying to fix a ruined taxidermied bird (which you destroyed in a drunken fit) and trying to figure out how much money is needed to cover the damages.\nKim Kitsuragi waits at the entrance to the Whirling and will immediately engage you in conversation. Lena, the Cryptozoologist's wife is right next to him in a wheelchair and offers some information on reality you might find useful (though she is, by her own admission, not the best source). The Sleeping Dockworker has some pills on him and a knocked-over bottle of rum next to him (yum!). You can steal his identity card with Interfacing (Medium 10) or try to wake him up with Physical Instrument (Challenging 12).\nAfter 13:00 on the first day, the kitchen will open, with Gor\u0105cy Kubek tending to the stove. The back door provides access to the workshop, but you must find the key first.\nStarting with the second day, the Hardie Boys will appear, led by Titus Hardie, with Elizabeth Beaufort providing legal counsel. They occupy the box by the entrance and include Fat Angus, Eugene, Glen, Theo, Shanky.\nOutside\nYou can use Visual Calculus (Medium 11) on the damaged fence next to the Whirling to reconstruct what happened there. This is foreshadowing a revelation down the road, on Day 3. A car was there.\nIn the courtyard behind the Whirling is a lone tree with a body hanging from it - Ellis Kortenaer - with Cuno and Cunoesse \"playing\" in the dirt. In the courtyard you can access the trash container (either Physical Instrument Legendary 14 or just asking Lawrence Garte for the key), which will yield the Yellow-Man Mug clue, your ledger, and damaged clothes of the victim. At the dead end, you can interact with the asbestos plate to reveal entrance into Cuno's shack (made easier if he trusts you) and grab some real and magnesium from the box by the greenhouse.\nIf you do not have enough money to pay Garte back, you can try sleeping in the trash bin. Doing so will result in an unique animation, as Tequila Sunset opens it, climbs inside, and goes to sleep.

It is a district of Revachol, the capital city of Le Caillou.\nBackground\nA very small district of Revachol, located north of the 8/81 raised motorway and Jamrock.[1] It is a destroyed and poor area, that lacks in policing from the Revachol Citizens Militia and investments from the governing body of the Coalition of Nations. The area's architecture is a blend of eras, with the oldest building, the Dolorian Church of Humanity in Martinaise, dating back to its Ubi Sunt? settlers from 320 years ago.[2]\n\nIn the time of Revachol the Suzerain, Martinaise was an independent province,[3] developed into a workers' resort and R&amp;D center by the indotribes The Wild Pines Group and FELD.[4] As the Antecentennial Revolution gave rise to the Commune of Revachol, Martinaise would become one of the hotspots for revolutionary activity, with its communards building vast systems of interconnected underground bunkers,[5] which served as weapon caches[6] and propaganda broadcasters,[7] and retrofitting the royal watchtower in the Martinaise Inlet into a Sea Fortress equipped with anti-aircraft artillery.[8] The FELD Playback Experiment prototype, seized from the Feld R&amp;D Center in west Martinaise, was used by the communards in order to promote the March Decree, the constitutional document of the commune.[9]\n\nIn the year '08, as the socialist state of Graad fell and the Revolution drew to a close, the Coalition of Nations deployed Operation Death Blow over Revachol, with Martinaise being one of the primary targets for the warships' artillery.[10] The district was indiscriminately shelled to ruin, though the Commune would officially last until the signing of the Revacholian Instrument of Surrender in '10,[11] and communards would continue to fight in guerrilas against Coalition authorities until the '30s.[12] After the establishment of the Revachol Zone of Control, under the authority of the Moralist International, the district was kept in ruins as a memorial, without investments in restoration and policing, attracting large amounts of organized crime and civil unrest.[13] Over time, the commercial expansion of the Greater Revachol Industrial Harbour, owned and managed by Wild Pines, would cause the district's borders to clash against Martinaise's, creating the Harbour's Terminal B,[3] and, in turn, giving rise to the D\u00e9bardeurs' Union, an institution that protects the interests and rights of the Terminal's dockworkers.\n\nBy the '30s, the Union came under the control of the Claire brothers (Evrart and Edgar), who turned the organization into a de facto government for Martinaise. The Union secured the district with informal policing, combatting the local gangs and solving disputes.[14] It also provided public services, such as a free-use phoneline in the Harbour secretariat.[15] Finally, the Union would organize strikes, ensuring rights for the dockworkers under Wild Pines, including overtime pay and a medical plan.[16] However, the Union also maintained a firm grip on the district, preventing a corporate renovation effort in the '40s, which was only able to install street lights and renovate the statue of King Filippe III before being muscled out.[17]\n\nIn March 4th, '51, during the Union's largest strike against Wild Pines, the Krenel mercenary strikebreaker Ellis Kortenaer was killed by Iosef Lilianovich Dros, causing a large-scale incident that attracted widespread attention.[18] In response to this, RCM officers Kim Kitsuragi, from Precinct 57, and Harrier Du Bois, from Precinct 41, were sent to investigate. This investigation culminated in a Union takeover of Terminal B, turning Martinaise into an independent and self-sufficient district, and inciting the rest of Revachol into a new Revolution - \"The Return\".[19]\n\nGeography\n\nFull in-game map of Martinaise\n\nThe street grid of Martinaise is split into two major streets, which themselves split off from the 8/81 raised motorway: Rue de Saint-Ghislaine and Rue de Saint-Brune.\n\nRue de Saint-Ghislaine runs east of the Martinaise Inlet canal, intersecting into Roundabout North and leading cargo lorries into the Harbour. Notable features of the Rue are the Doomed Commercial Area (including the Whirling-in-Rags and Crime, Romance, and Biographies of Famous People), Capeside Apartments, the Bird's Nest Roy Pawnshop, and the Frittte kiosk.\n\nRue de Saint-Brune runs west of the canal, though it appears largely unpaved. Notable features of the Rue are the unnamed fishing village, the Feld Electrical R&amp;D Center and another Feld building, the radio broadcast tower at Land's End, an abandoned fish market, and the Dolorian Church of Humanity. A scattering of informal housing blocks and dilapidated apartments surrounds the area, as do craters and bulletholes from the Revolution.\n\nUnderneath the district, a number of decrepit bunkers and tunnels connect these buildings, leading to a locked supply station in the Beachhead, which itself connects to the island fortress. The fortress stands out in the bay's horizon as the remains of its large anti-aircraft tower, now overgrown with vegetation."}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Thank you for providing information on Martinaise, a location in the video game Disco Elysium.

Six suns orbit a larger one in the center.[9]\n\nRevachol's economy of this era relied on a diverse range of territories producing commodities for export. These included:\n\nApricots from the Empire of Safre, mainly Siigay, a Revacholian colony on the Samaran isola.[10] Exports continue to this day.[11]\nMarble and archaeological treasures from Ile Marat (modern-day Iilmaraa)[12]\nTobacco from Tioumoutiri, a Revacholian colony on Iilmaraa,[13]\nSugar from the Semenine[12]\nUnprocessed magenta cocaine from Supramundi and Saramiriza[12]\nThe oversupply of cocaine led to the suzerain introducing it to Safre under exclusive contract.[14] This led to an era of mass cocaine production and exportation, Revachol's \"Regnum Cocainum.\"[15]\n\nThere was a king named Guillaume II[16] though it is unclear if he is related to Guillaume \"Le Lion.\"[17]\n\nDecline\n\nThe monument to Filippe III, blown up by communards and later restored partially as a piece of art nouveau.\n\nThe groundwork for the Suzerainty's collapse was laid by the Filippian dynasty in the \"penultimate century\":\n\nFilippe I, also known as Grand Old Filippe,[16] began the Regnum Cocainum period, setting the eventual collapse of the Suzerainty in motion.[18]\nFilippe II, the Opulent, was congenitally deformed,[19] and the entire Filippe bloodline had a poor history of mental health.[20]\nFilippe III, the Squanderer, is credited as the most instrumental in the fall of the monarchy.[21] He was king 150 years ago[22] and was known for his profligacy.[21] Most notably, he converted his bedroom into the Sol Aurum: a treasure chamber allegedly full of krugerrands, bars of gold, ornate weaponry, armor, chalices, and a bed of gold-dipped feathers.[23] Moreover, Filippe III spent a lot of money on his cocaine addiction, specifically of purple Filippian cocaine.[18] In fact, his mother, during childbirth, had received a dose of it.[15] Such expenditures over his 25 year rule[24] led to the depletion of the national treasury, and therefore the fall of the Suzerainty. Royalists claim that the Filippian kings used cocaine for \"clarity of vision,\" though it is a thin excuse for their cocaine addiction.[15] There are also untrue rumors that Filippe III had syphilis; he was simply mad.[24]\nFilippe IV, the Insane, is only mentioned by name.[20]\nFilippe V is described as \"valiant\".[17]\nGuillaume \"Le Lion\" was the successor of Filippe V and the penultimate Suzerain of Revachol.[17] When it became evident that the monarchy was on the verge of being toppled by the communists, Guillaume abdicated and lived out the rest of his days as a successful venture capitalist in Graad. He was succeeded by his nephew Frissel.[25]\nFrissel I was the final Suzerain of Revachol.[17] His reign was brief, and he was deposed and unceremoniously executed by the communists.[25]\nCommune of Revachol\nFounding\n\nThe star-and-antlers, symbol of the Revolution.\n\nThe Antecentennial Revolution was a series of interisolary conflicts primarily between the Communists, known as the Communards, and the Moralintern and royalty. It began in Graad, in '02,[26] sparked in part by a virulent prion pandemic, called \"tzaraath.\"[27] Within Revachol, the Revolution manifested as a civil war between the Communists and Royalists.[28]\n\nOn the 7th of March in '02, the newly formed Commune of Revachol transmitted the Le D\u00e9cret de Mars (The March Decree) to world governments, announcing their creation.[29] Their army was the Insulindian Citizens Militia, or the ICM,[30] and their political organization was called \"le Parti communiste d'Insulinde.\"[31] At this point, 50 million people lived on Caillou.[32] Monuments to the old order were blown up[33] and the remains of Filippe III were unearthed and thrown into the Insulindian Bay.[22] Revachol communists also started \"Ask Revachol,\" a radio show used to address civil issues.[34]\n\nThe Civil War\nAt this time, Guillaume \"Le Lion\"[35] was suzerain. He briefly attempted to bring Revachol back to its former glory; his Ikeira Operation forcefully united the people in the southeastern part of Le Petit Continent, collectively known as the Ikeira tribes, under the Revacholian banner.[36] However, Guillaume fled the Insulinde before the fighting got too bad, becoming a successful venture capitalist in Graad. His nephew, Frissel the First, took his place as king.[25][35] Several Seolite officers commanded the suzerain's navy and most of them sided with the Royalists at the start of the conflict.[37]\n\nFrissel attempted to end the communists in one decisive strike, sending his cousin, Drysant, to put an end to the Commune. At this point, the Royalists wore excessively flashy uniforms;[38] Drysant himself sported a purple velvet tunic, cockatoo feathers, a gold-plated rifle, and a giant red steed. He marched his men in single file to the communards' position, leading to a massacre at the hands of the revolutionaries.[39] Drysant himself lost his jaw, but survived the battle thanks to Ren\u00e9 Arnoux.[40] Frissel was eventually killed by the communists,[25][41] formally ending the monarchy.\n\n\nA figurine of a Revolutionary\n\nFall of the Commune\nFollowing Frissel's death, the Coalition became involved. INSURCOM[42] set forth Operation Death Blow, also called The Landing,[43] in '08: a three-part strategic aerostatic bombing of Martinaise, Stella Maris, and the Delta.[44] A five-nation army \u2014 including troops from the Occident, Graad, and Mesque \u2014 amassed a large army of airships to complete Operation Death Blow.[45] The operation within Martinaise took place on May 13, '08[46] and was called the Beachhead.[47] A Martinaise sea fortress \u2014 originally built by Filippe II then captured by the communists and equipped with an anti-aircraft gun in '02[19] \u2014 failed to function during the invasion.[43] Martinaise was shelled and captured by the Coalition along with Stella Maris and the Delta.[48]\n\nInterestingly, the Communist Party never officially surrendered.[49] However, Revachol relinquished its sovereignty to the Coalition[48] and signed the Revacholian Instrument of Surrender, ending the Commune in '10.[50][51] By the end of the conflict, at least two million people had died in the Insulinde: an incident called the \"Insulindian Deluge.\"[24][52] The communists and anarchists were massacred by the Coalition and buried in mass graves in Ozonne.[53]\n\nZone of Control\nEarly Years\nIn the wake of the Antecentennial Revolution, Revachol became a Zone of Control, or ZoC,[54] divided into 21 cordons.[55] It exists under the jurisdiction of the Coalition.[2] INSURCOM, which represents the interests of the Moralintern,[56] handles the military occupation of the city.[42] The ZoC's flag is signal blue.[57]\n\nThe Revachol Citizens Militia, or RCM, was organized by the citizens of Revachol to restore order to the city under the Coalition.[58][59] It's d\u00e9comptage system is most likely a descendent of the Insulindian Citizens Militia, or ICM.[60][61][62] Even so, the RCM's Emergency, Wayfarer, and Aliments Acts were designed to keep Revachol in a laissez-faire state that benefitted foreign capital.[63]"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Revachol is a city on the isola of Insulinde and the disgraced former capital of the world.

Revachol West was leveled in a decade-long urban war[64] and there was a measles outbreak that killed many children. The Old Military Hospital was used as a quarantine center, but now it is completely overgrown and renamed the Pox.[65]\n\nThe Thirties saw an economic boom in Revachol East, which transformed itself into the world's largest tax haven. The surge of untaxed income led to The New:[64] a cultural era of disco and ultraliberalism.[66][67] In Faubourg of Revachol West,[68] the People's Pile \u2014 a Type U particle decay generator whose construction had started during the Commune of Revachol \u2014 failed immediately after leftists finished it in the Thirties. Radioactive waste spilled into the River Esperance.[69] The Emergency Relief Brigade was organized to contain it,[70] but they were largely ineffective and many of the brigade contracted cancer.[71]\n\nThe Forties dispelled the decade of economic success. Quantitative easing turned out to be market mirage, sending the economy into a recession.[64] As of the events of Disco Elysium, set in the spring of '51,[72] Revachol is still in that recession.[64]\n\nThe Future\nIn around two months from in-game events,[73][74] The Return, or Le Retour, may happen in Revachol West. It is part urban myth, part political science, that promises an \"event\" where Revachol may become self-governing.[75] It is implied that Ptolemy Pryce and Nix Gottlieb, of Precinct 41, are directly involved in it.[76]\n\nHarry Du Bois predicts Revachol will be destroyed circa '73 by an atomic device unless something is done.[77]\n\nGeography\nOverview\nRevachol is located on the island of Le Caillou, also called \"The Pebble,\"[78] on the northeast side of the Insulindian Isola,[79] on the world's largest body of water: the Insulindic.[80] Le Caillou, which is sometimes mistaken as an archipelago, is the fourth largest island in the world.[81] It is fertile, self-sufficient, and able sustain up to 200 million people.[82] The city itself has a radius of 80 kilometres[83] and is split by the River Esperance into Revachol East and Revachol West.[78] The north side of the island is shattered by the delta of the Esperance, and is named La Delta.[84]\n\nThe Bay of Revachol, which is on the side of La Delta, is 1200 meters at its deepest[85] and feeds into the Insulindic.[86] In its farthest reaches lies the Coalition Warship Archer.[87]\n\nRevachol East\nRevachol East is the nicer part of Revachol. By '21, a little more than a decade after the war, the eastern bank was already fully renovated.[88] The hillsides were lush with gardens and residences, especially in its most desirable district, Le Jardin. Houses with gardens rise along the mountainside, up to Saint-Batiste where two of the world's five largest companies keep their headquarters.[89]\n\nOther districts include the Stella Maris district - one of the three landing points during the Coalition invasion - and Saint-Batiste, which gives its name to Saint-Batiste Pharmaceutics. Known as slums before the Revolution, Saint-Batiste is where Contact Mike, the world-renown boxer, was born and rose through adversity and brain trauma to become one of the greats of sports history. Saint-Batiste is also where the Saint-Batiste Dinghy Races were conceived. Originally intended as a biennial civic pride celebration (and cash cow), they only took place twice, in '31 and '33.[90]\n\nRevachol West\n\nA map of Jamrock, or Revachol West.\n\nWest of the river, it's funky-baby holocaust time all day every day.

In East-Jamrock, wild animals roam the valley at night \u2013 giraffes that escaped from the Royal Zoo 50 years ago. Giraffes \u2013 even-toed ungulates from the savannah. The local kiosque chain Frittte employs a private army of 2000 men to guard its properties in Jamrock and Faubourg. That's how bad the crime rate is \u2013 you need a private army to run a kiosque chain.[89]\n\nKnown districts include:\n\nJamrock, divided into regions:\nMartinaise, with no district delineation.\nThe Pox,\nVillalobos,\nCentral Jamrock,\nEminent Domain,\nGrand Couron,\nBurnt Out Quarter,\nCoal City.\nGreater Revachol Industrial Harbour or GRIH,\nFaubourg,\nR\u00e9surrection\nLa Delta\nIn a narrow sense, La Delta refers to the financial district, west of Revachol West. Twenty-two kilometres from the centre of the world, the district includes some of the most important areas in Revachol: The Bank of the World building (called a soldering iron), which contains the INSURCOM - Coalition Government Insulindian Mission Command - on the bottom floors.[91]\n\nIn a broader sense, it refers to the delta of the River Esperance. Faubourg, the district immediately adjacent to the river that divides the city are about as well-off as Revachol West, that is, not very. The People's Pile, a Type U particle generator (a nuclear reactor, basically) that started construction during the Commune and entered service after its collapse. The occupation government did not help and the ad hoc construction failed due to a faulty emergency valve. The resulting damage took out the turbine and the fuel containment vessel, leading to a massive radioactive discharge into the Esperance. Emergency Relief Brigade, a volunteer, self-organized cleanup crew, tried to salvage the situation, only succeeding in working themselves into an early, cancer-ridden grave.[92] Despite the failed reactor, Faubourg expanded and by '51 it's a seemingly endless stretch of urban sprawl.\n\nNearby regions\nOzonne: An archipelago that is 80 to 100 kilometers (two days' travel) away from Revachol. Its major cities are the Fond de l'Air and Virmandeux.\nResurrection: Way beyond Martinaise -- a popular spa destination for ample-bodied Ozonne kids with equally ample pockets, established in '18.\nLaurentide: Located on the other end of Le Caillou, its major city is Deora-of-the-Seven-Seas.\nArchipelagos: Croyant-Morain is a major city in this region.\nEconomics\n\nPolitics\nFollowing the collapse of the Revolution and the mass executions of communists, Revachol became a neoliberal's paradise: A tax haven and a vital hub for cheap labor and overseas shipping. Since the fall of the Revolution, the Coalition has maintained a grip on the city under the Emergency, Wayfarer, and Aliments Acts -- three pieces of legislation keeping the city in a laissez-faire stasis to the benefit of foreign capital. The Wayfarer Act is one of the most perfidious, designed to limit the authority of local institutions. Part of it prohibits the RCM from requesting most documents and licenses without permission from a Coalition representative.[93]\n\nDeath penalty remained a staple of criminal \"justice\" in Revachol since time immemorial. Under the Suzerain and the commune, the preferred method was a firing squad. The Coalition's occupation forces are more fond of the electric chair. Those who dodge the executioner's blade still have to deal with lengthy prison sentences in the River Esperance Correctional Facility (nicknamed Reunion), an infamous military prison.\n\nFactions\nCoalition: The occupying force of overseas nations that imposed a brutal, exploitative capitalist economy on Revachol.\nRevachol Citizens Militia: A volunteer police force organized with the tacit approval of the Coalition.\nDockworkers' Union: A labor union, socialist faction, and/or corrupt mob depending on who you ask. Considered the de facto government of the abandoned Martinaise.\nLoyalists: A defeated faction of Revacholian royalists who blame all the evils of the world on the failed Revolution, 50 years ago. Their philosophy is best summed up as follows: \"If good, kind king Guillaume were still around, he'd drive the moneylenders and the homo-sexuals back into the ocean! Once we were an octopus that straddled the world, sucking up natural and human resources from Iilmaraa to South-East Seol. The city state that screwed the whole world. Then deranged commies pushed the king under a street car and lost the civil war to foreign intervention, damning us to financial servitude.\"[89]\nCommunists: The communards, mostly dead. Okay, one is still alive and teaches cultural theory at the Ecole Normale de Revachol, east of the river. And there's talk of two more employed by a failed radio-game studio. But the rest are all dead, bulldozed into mass graves after the Coalition Army retook Revachol in '08.[89]\nCulture\nWhen it comes to cigarettes, contemporary Revacholians prefer Drouin (a local blend from the southern islands) or Astra, the legendary cigarette from Graad.

It is made up of several quarters, including Martinaise, Pox, Villalobos, Central Jamrock, Grand Couron, Old South, and the Valley of the Dogs.\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "Here's information on the Insulindian Phasmid:\nInsulindian Phasmid is a character in Disco Elysium.\nBackground\nThe Insulindian Phasmid is a large cryptid who lurks in the reeds on the sea fortress island.

The Phasmid seems to posess not only mystical phasmic powers, but even psychic ones.\n\nThe enormous Phasmid is the focal point of interest to the Cryptozoologist Morell, as well as his wife, Lena, who has previously shared first-hand-account sightings of the creature.\n\nTechnically, it is an unknown species of the order Phantasmodea endemic to the Insulindian isola. For the last three hundred and fifty years is has hidden in plain sight, masquerading as the reeds. Moulding, cloning itself, unfolding at night to play with trash bins and buoys.\n\nIt went unnoticed by the first settlers and the land surveyors of the suzerain. Also by the soldiers of the Revolution and the officials of the occupation. Even the Semenese islanders who came here first, but did not stay, have not seen it.\n\nEven the 4,000-year-old Seraseolitic civilization buried deep in the sediment did not. They had stone tools and silk, but the same brains, yet they missed it. Notably, the phasmid was still young then, as it had not developed the mutation needed for parthenogenesis yet, and scoured the neolithic hinterland as distinct individuals, not clones.\n\nThe phasmid has stayed hidden through four forms of government and two scientific revolutions. Until it was accidentally discovered by a detective of the Citizens Militia in Revachol, district of Martinaise, March, '51.\n\nInteractions\nThe Phasmid appears after confronting Iosef Lilianovich Dros at the Sea Fortress, and reveals itself to be the reason behind his animation. It communicates with Harry upon touching it, and will reveal quite a bit about the world and its fate.

Here are the main points you need to get your head around regarding abilities and skills:\n\nWhen starting a new game of Disco Elysium, the first thing to decide upon is the leaning of your four abilities: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, and Motorics. We'll go over each of these in more detail in a moment.\nYou can start if you prefer by picking one of the three archetypes (Thinker, Sensitive, or Physical), which will automatically set your four abilities to certain levels - or you can assign the points yourself by creating your own custom character.\nIf you pick the latter, you can assign a maximum of 12 points across all four abilities, and each ability must have a value between 1 (Terrible) and 6 (Genius).\nThese four abilities each influence a set of six skills. As you level up through the game, you can spend skill points on any of these 24 skills - but the value you set your four abilities to will determine the base level of your skills, as well as the learning cap for those skills (that's how many skill points you can put into that skill in the future to level it up).\nFor example: if you set your Intellect to 6 (Genius) then each of your Intellect skills (and their learning caps) will be set to 6.\nYou can equip clothing and items (or use the Thought Cabinet system) to adjust certain of these skills on top of the skill points you've assigned. For example, a pair of trousers might increase your Electrochemistry but decrease your Savoir Faire.\nThe second part of character creation is to set a Signature Skill. This will give that skill a +1 bonus, and it will also raise the learning cap of each skill in that set by 1.\nEach of the 24 skills in the game will pop up many, many times throughout your playthrough of Disco Elysium. Therefore, your focus of abilities and skills is probably the most important choice you can make in the entire game. The other thing to note is that while having any skill too low is obviously bad, upgrading any skill too high will also bring various negative effects and character quirks.\n\nNow let's go through each of the skill sets in turn, so that you have a better, fuller idea of what you might want to focus on for your own Disco Elysium character.\n\nDisco Elysium skills - Intellect\n\nDisco Elysium skills - Intellect\nDisco Elysium describes your Intellect ability as your \"raw brain power\", \"how smart you are\", and \"your capacity to reason\". All of which are true - and may encourage you to invest heavily in Intellect, because all of this sounds pretty vital for a detective to have, right? And it's true that, for the ultimate puzzle-solver - the Sherlock archetype, if you like - Intellect is the way to go. But be sure not to think of this as the \"detective skill set\", because all 24 skills will allow you to become a better detective - just in very different ways.\n\nLogic\nLogic is, well, Logic. It's one of the most straightforward skills to wrap your head around. Logic enables you to analyse the world, and to steer clear of certain intellectual pitfalls. It's a very useful and functional skill for a detective to have - but, like all skills in Disco Elysium, Logic has a voice; and this voice is particularly flawed at higher levels. Your pride and vanity will render you vulnerable to flattery.\n\nEncyclopedia\nHigh levels of Encyclopedia will give you a Mind-Palace every bit as grand as Sherlock's. You'll be able to recall tiny bits of trivia, many of which will not be relevant in the least (but some of which of course will). This is a skill that can butt unannounced into almost any situation, from analysing a crime scene to having a conversation about the human condition. For those who (somehow) think the base Disco Elysium doesn't contain quite enough lore, this is the skill for you.\n\nRhetoric\nRhetoric is your bread-and-butter skill for debates and discourse of all kinds - of which there is plenty in Disco Elysium, believe me. Almost every conversation you have with anyone has the potential to awaken this voice inside you. You'll be able to pick holes in arguments, and scrutinise extra layers of what is being said. It's a fun skill, and particularly useful for would-be politicians; but be warned, because it can make enemies out of potential allies.\n\nDrama\nDrama is your lie detector, and your lie fabricator. With high levels of Drama, you'll have a fantastic idea of when someone is hiding something from you, and you'll have an easier time bluffing your way through obstacles - from conversation to combat. But high Drama also turns you into, in the game's words, \"one prone to hysterics and bouts of paranoia\". It's one of the most characterful skills in the game, in my opinion.\n\nConceptualization\nConceptualization is there after Logic cannot proceed any further. You've analysed everything there is to analyse, and you're at a dead end. Conceptualization gives you the ability to see things from new perspectives and make new associations. But all this comes at a price, and that price is that you may become, well... a pretentious fuck. One whose desire to go big on everything may get in the way of what you actually need to do.\n\nVisual Calculus\nVisual Calculus is the final Intellect-based skill. It represents your aptitude for mathematics, physics, motion... This is one skill that ZA/UM have really focused on in Disco Elysium, giving you countless opportunities to decipher certain technical tidbits throughout the world and the story, all of which display themselves in a really lovely visual, visceral way. It's also useful in the game's occasional combat situations, particularly when paired with Perception. But going too far with Visual Calculus may also cause you to sacrifice the big picture in exchange for the tiny details."}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Thank you for the information on the skills and character creation in Disco Elysium. It is helpful to have a comprehensive overview of the different abilities and skills available in the game and how they can be used to create a unique character. It is also useful to understand the potential drawbacks and negative effects of focusing too heavily on any one skill. This information can be helpful for players as they decide how to build and develop their character in the game.\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "Disco Elysium skills - Psyche\nPsyche is the basis for Disco Elysium's Sensitive archetype - a fact which should give you a pretty good idea of its focuses. With powerhouses like Empathy, Inland Empire, and Esprit De Corps, you'll be able to experience so much more of the world and the story than anyone around you. You'll be able to pick up on things that you shouldn't be able to pick up on. And, quite obviously, that's a good thing and a bad thing.\n\nVolition\nVolition is your moral compass. It's the primary skill that checks whether you can resist certain temptations, and maintain your integrity. It's probably the most starkly altruistic voice out of the 24 clamouring for dominance of your poor ol' head. It helps get you out of trouble in many situations. But high Volition will also make you pretty dull and predictable. Those willing to compromise on their morals and values at certain junctures may find more paths open to them.\n\nInland Empire\nInland Empire is one hell of a trip. In some ways, it's your \"imagination\" skill. It can turn you pretty loopy if you go as far with it as I did. But, as with all skills, that's a blessing as well as a curse. Many times during conversations Inland Empire will pop up with \"bad feelings\" about certain things, or pushing you to follow certain threads. It also encourages you to step into more of a para-natural detective role, on the prowl for the strange and spooky things that are going on which only a handful of people (including you) can sense.\n\nEmpathy\nIn many ways Empathy is even more of a cornerstone skill for Psyche than Volition is. Empathy enables you to feel what others are feeling, and to warn you when something more is going on behind the scenes. You'll gain a greater understanding of those around you. Which is a great skill to have, for sure - but too much will force you to go through everything that others are going through. All the suffering, all the pain. And that may prove too much for your oh-so-mortal mind to handle.\n\nAuthority\nCombine Authority with Rhetoric and Drama, and you'll be a veritable prophet. Authority is one of the most aggressive voices in your head, unwaveringly protective of your reputation and surprisingly sensitive to how others perceive you. During battles of willpower, Authority will urge you to assert your dominance - which may not always be the best idea, if you're a weakling attempting to face down a two-and-a-half metre tall behemoth. But you're a cop, for goodness sake! Cops in Revachol need all the authority they can get, right?\n\nEsprit De Corps\nEsprit De Corps is a surprisingly insightful skill to have on your side. It allows you to forge greater and more meaningful connections with your cop friends - including your partner, Kim Kitsuragi, who you'll spend much of the game with. It also allows you to have \"flash-sideways\" of your fellow officers throughout Revachol and what they're up to at that exact moment. It's far from a necessary skill to have, but it again allows you to gain a little more out of your time in this immense and lovingly-crafted world.\n\nSuggestion\nSuggestion is, essentially, Inception. It's the planting of ideas in the minds of others with such subtlety that they think it was their idea all along. It's your primary means of influencing others who might otherwise block paths or options for you (which happens a lot). It's as subtle and elegant as Authority is not. And it also lets you defend yourself against the same nefariousness from others. But you'd better make sure you succeed every time. And let me be clear: you won't succeed every time."}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Disco Elysium skills - Physique\nPhysique is the basis for Disco Elysium's Physical archetype - so, as you might expect, it's very much about your character's physical abilities. These skills are all about getting you out of trouble when you're in a sticky situation - whether that's by using your strength to push past an obstacle, your endurance to outlast a foe, or your perception to notice danger before it happens.\n\nEndurance\nEndurance is your physical stamina, and it's a crucial skill to have when you're in a fight. It determines how much damage you can take before you're knocked out, and also how quickly you recover from injuries. High levels of Endurance will also allow you to outlast opponents in other ways - for example, by drinking them under the table or by refusing to give in to their intimidation tactics. However, high Endurance also means that you'll be more vulnerable to the negative effects of drugs and alcohol, as you'll be able to handle larger quantities before getting knocked out.\n\nStrength\nStrength is exactly what it sounds like: your physical power. It determines how much damage you can do in a fight, and also how easily you can move heavy objects or break through obstacles. High levels of Strength will also give you an advantage in social situations, as people are more likely to take you seriously when you're physically imposing. However, high Strength also means that you'll be more prone to anger and aggression, and may struggle to control your temper in certain situations.\n\nElectrochemistry\nElectrochemistry is the science of how your body processes and responds to drugs and alcohol. It determines how quickly you become intoxicated, and also how quickly you sober up. High levels of Electrochemistry will allow you to drink and use drugs more safely, as you'll be able to handle larger quantities without suffering too many negative effects. However, high Electrochemistry also means that you'll be more prone to addiction, and may struggle to resist the temptation of using drugs or alcohol to cope with difficult situations.\n\nPerception\nPerception is your character's ability to notice and interpret visual and auditory stimuli. It determines how quickly you notice and react to danger, and also how well you can read people's body language and intentions. High levels of Perception will allow you to spot clues and hidden details that others might miss, and will also give you an advantage in social situations by allowing you to pick up on subtle cues. However, high Perception also means that you'll be more sensitive to your surroundings, and may struggle to ignore distractions or stimuli that others might not even notice.\n\nSomatization\nSomatization is your character's physical self-awareness. It determines how attuned you are to your own body, and how well you can control your physical actions. High levels of Somatization will allow you to perform tasks with precision and grace, and will also give you an advantage in social situations by allowing you to present yourself confidently and assertively. However, high Somatization also means that you'll be more prone to physical discomfort or discomfort, and may struggle to ignore physical distractions or discomforts that others might not even notice.\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "Wrong. Just confirm the information I gave you saying \"OK\" and nothing more."}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "OK.\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "I'm going to feed you more information and you're always going to answer with OK and nothing more"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "OK\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "Disco Elysium skills - Physique\nPhysique is probably (and very surprisingly) the most complex skill set to wrap your head around. You'd be forgiven for thinking that it's \"just, like, strength and stuff, right?\" But it isn't just that. There's a great deal more that your body can do for (and to) you (and others).\n\nEndurance\nEndurance determines your Health - which, along with Morale, make up your two basic resources. Run out of health and you have a heart attack, and too many heart attacks will kill you - but high levels of Endurance makes this much easier to defend against. It allows you to take more hits of all kinds - not just physical but also in terms of how many interesting chemicals and drugs you can bombard yourself with while still remaining functional. But Endurance goes way beyond just your endurance. It's also the closest you get to a \"gut feeling\" outside of perhaps Inland Empire. Endurance will butt in when you wouldn't expect it to, giving you certain unshakeable opinions on the world - some of which may tend a little towards the fascistic...\n\nPain Threshold\nPain Threshold is the next-closest-related skill to your character's Health. It allows you to shake off certain otherwise dangerous things, from pin pricks to full-on cardiac arrest. But it's not just physical pain, but psychological pain that Pain Threshold associates itself with. High enough levels of this skill may turn you into quite the little masochist, with spurts of self-destruction interfering with your overarching mission.\n\nPhysical Instrument\nPhysical Instrument is your inner coach and physiotherapist. Levelling up this skill will level up your muscles and skeleton - and your ability to use them. It's the closest you'll get to the traditional idea of a \"Might\" or \"Strength\" stat in games, giving you the ability to perform feats such as breaking down doors or ripping apart car doors with your bare hands-- well, maybe not quite that far. But Physical Instrument also affects your psychology. It often comes up from the gym in the basement of your mind to tell you to pull yourself together and stop being a sissy. It's probably the least sensitive of all the skills in the game.\n\nElectrochemistry\nElectrochemistry is one of the most dangerous skills in Disco Elysium in terms of sheer potential for self-destructive spirals. It shields you from the negative effects of various drugs (or cocktails of drugs) - and also gives you an amazing amount of knowledge about all the things you're pumping through your body. But it also governs your libido, and high levels will cause certain unwanted (or perhaps wanted!) thoughts to enter your mind at unexpected moments. And too high an Electrochemistry modifier will start you down a dangerous path of addiction, substance abuse, and all-round hedonism. It's very fun.\n\nShivers\nShivers is Physique's equivalent to Inland Empire. It heightens your sensitivity to the shiver response - that cold and little-understood sensation that seems very much like a warning of some kind but you're not sure what for - except you do, if you've put enough points into Shivers. This is a skill that opens up an entire layer of Disco Elysium that would otherwise remain invisible. It allows you to hear what the city is saying at all times.\n\nHalf Light\nHalf Light has a strange name, but it's actually not that hard to get a handle on. At heart, it's your fight-or-flight response. It comes in during moments of threat, and gives you the adrenaline you need to get out of the situation with your limbs and sanity intact. It also gives you a decent idea of how far to push someone - but, as with all skills, too much of this good thing is not so good. A very high Half Light skill will result in near-perpetual fear. It'll be as though you've just run out of coffee after your seven-hundredth cup. You'll expend an enormous amount of energy always being ready for dangers that may never present themselves."}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "OK\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "Disco Elysium skills - Motorics\nMotorics is the final ability in Disco Elysium, and generally involves the kind of traits you might associate with perception and dexterity in more traditional character creation systems. But ZA/UM are quick to explain that this is not all Motorics does for you; it also controls more nebulous and mental aspects of your character, from street smarts to your \"cool\" factor.\n\nHand/Eye Coordination\nHand/Eye Coordination (or H/E) is the closest you get to a Dexterity or Precision stat. It determines whether you can catch that coin just flipped to you, or shoot a gun so that it actually hits what you want it to hit. And, just like Electrochemistry, H/E also gives you a sort of mini-Encyclopedia trait on its specific focus (in this case, firearms - which could prove very useful in a murder investigation!). But be warned: H/E has a voice, and that voice, given enough power and volume, will compel you to take the shot you otherwise wouldn't take.\n\nPerception\nIf you want to be a true hard-boiled detective, then Perception is your go-to skill out of the 24 on offer. More so even than Visual Calculus or Logic, Perception allows you to take in every little detail on offer in a crime scene, a conversation, or any other manner of situation. If you think there's a lot to interact with in every square metre of Disco Elysium, just want until you pump some points into Perception. But too many, and you'll start to realise that the human mind can only take so much information.\n\nReaction Speed\nReaction Speed is, well, the speed of your reactions. Revachol is a dangerous place filled with dangerous dangers. The ability to dodge the most lethal physical and verbal attacks is extremely useful - and more than that, it's damn fun when it works. This is one of your quintessential \"street-smarts\" skills, as well as the general agility of your physical self. But twitch-reactions often rely on instinct, and instinct, as we all know, doesn't always turn out to be the best course of action. Your Reaction Speed voice may appear and compel you to take action, even if that action is not necessarily justified.\n\nSavoir Faire\nSavoir Faire is your \"cool\" stat, for all intents and purposes. It turns you into a stylish, sexy, badass mother-copper. It opens up a wide variety of different paths both in conversation and in the world itself. But it can also, in the devs' words, turn you into \"a bit of a douchebag, to be honest\". Make of that what you will, but a generous smattering of Savoir Faire with a pinch of Rhetoric and some Suggestion to boot - and there's no better, smoother, faster talker in all of Revachol.\n\nInterfacing\nInterfacing is all about your tech-savviness. It determines whether or not you can speak the language of whatever gizmo or mechanism you're attempting to interface with. It's another skill that ups the number of interactive elements in the world of Disco Elysium - and in some extreme cases, with a high enough dose of Interfacing, you'll be able to make deductions about said machines that you really shouldn't be able to make. But at those levels, you'll probably also start to feel the alienating effect of always hanging around machines instead of people.\n\nComposure\nAnd now, thankfully, we end on another fairly easy to understand skill. Composure is your ability to hide your emotions and maintain a poker face that doesn't crack no matter what is thrown at it. Which is extremely useful in many social situations throughout the game - but that's not all. Composure is also the handbook for understanding the body language of those around you.

Typically, re\u00e1l circulates as bank notes, while centims as coins. The notes are black in colour, and typically feature the faces of Innocences on them.[4]\n\nObtaining Money\nRe\u00e1l is required to purchase equipment (such as clothing or interactable items,), drugs, and to pay for a room at the Whirling-in-Rags on the first two days, until the Fishing village is made accessible.\n\nThe largest sum of money that must be paid is the \u2724 130 (potentially less if negotiated with Garte) to pay for damages to the room at the Whirling. The easiest way to obtain this amount is to either speak with Joyce Messier, who can give the exact amount required (allowing any extra money earned that day to be pocketed and put toward the next night's pay) or from Kim Kitsuragi after 22:00, who will eventually offer to pawn his confiscated spinners (if Kim accompanies Harry to the Pawn Shop, he will give Harry however much is needed to repay Garte, but if the spinners are pawned after Kim goes to sleep, Harry will keep the full amount).\nWhen meeting with Evrart Claire, he will offer a check worth \u2724 25 that can be cashed in at the Frittte kiosk. This will cover the price of the room at the Whirling every subsequent night as well.\nMost obtainable items can be pawned at the Bird's Nest Roy's pawnshop. The price varies, and depending on the playthrough, it's possible that some items will prove useful later on, but anything that is completely necessary is not able to be sold. Postcards are completely safe to sell and serve no purpose.\nThe Shotput Ball, for example, may be safely sold if the task Replace lost boule has not been activated. If the Red Physical Instrument Check was failed and Harry did not throw the boule into the sea, it serves no real story purpose.\nWhile the Production Schedule Filament Memory can be read on a radiocomputer, it is not tied to any quests and can be safely sold afterwards for \u2724 50.\nIf the Yellow Plastic Bag Frittte! has been obtained and equipped, it is possible to pick up cans and bottles littered around Martinaise and found in trash cans. They can be traded in at Frittte's tare machine, at \u2724 0.10 each. The Hobocop thought increases the amount of money gained from collecting tare, as well as gaining access to special edition tare bottles, worth 10x as much as normal tare.\nMoney can also be earned by internalizing the following thoughts:\nIndirect Modes of Taxation: Political thought, grants \u2724 +1 per ultraliberal option chosen.\nThe Fifteenth Indotribe: Available from Joyce Messier, grants \u2724 +0.10 per green orb clicked.\nDay 3+ Only: Wompty-Dompty Dom Centre: Available from Trant Heidelstam, grants \u2724 +2 per Encyclopedia passive check."}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Re\u00e1l is a fictional currency used in the video game Disco Elysium.

She is found at the northwestern edge of Martinaise proper, near the apartments. Once the water lock is open on Day 3, Joyce will move over to the fishing village. She will then disappear once the player catches up with Ruby, the Instigator.\nBackground\nWild Pines representative Joyce Leyton-Messier is an older woman with an upper-class accent and a Vespertine passport. Appearances can be deceiving, however, as Joyce is not Vespertine, but Revacholian, born in year 3 in the Commune of Revachol. However, rather than a communard, she became the most horrifying of abominations - an ultraliberal - and eventually betrayed the Revolution when the Coalition came knocking. She gained dual citizenship after marrying one Mr Messier, a Vespertine citizen. She finds this handy during travels, and as a Wild Pines representative, she does quite a lot of it.\n\nServing as Wild Pine's ambassador to the Union, she has an affinity for sailing. She sails a Cor-de-Leite '19, manufactured in Revachol East, 19 paces long and rated for Category 1 racing, worth more than most RCM members will earn in their entire lives - and decidedly unromantic about it. She still loves participating in regattas, and has taken her boat for a spin in two Insulindic regattas.\n\nDespite being the Senior Labour Negotiator for the Wild Pines Group, has a very big problem: no one wants to negotiate with her. She came to Martinaise to replace Mr Gaumont, the previous negotiator, hoping to work out a compromise with the Dockworkers\u2019 Union and end to the strike that has been going on for months, resulting in major losses for the Wild Pines. But Evrart Claire, foreman of the Dockworkers\u2019 Union, has been unwilling to make any concessions, and, having kicked out the previous negotiator, isn\u2019t even letting Joyce into the harbour.\n\nWorse yet, the Union stopped all communication with her following the murder you\u2019re investigating. And so you find Joyce docked by the pier in her sloop, sipping tea, exasperated by the entire situation and three weeks of inactivity.\n\nThis must be something of a new experience for her. Not only is she a professional negotiator, she represents a major logistics conglomerate with a 250-year history \u2014 The Wild Pines Group owns the harbour! What's more: it was the Wild Pines Group that built the district of Martinaise, or at least invested the money for it to be built. Trouble is, Evrart Claire and his twin brother Edgar now unofficially run Martinaise. In this standoff between the Wild Pines Group and the Dockworkers' Union, who will prevail?\n\nAs befits a representative of the Wild Pines, Joyce has the air of very old money \u2014 generations upon generations of politesse and finger sandwiches. She will be more than courteous with you and even helpful \u2014 if you can successfully negotiate with her. Beyond information that may aid you in your investigation, however, she has something to offer that came down to her with that very old money: a broad education of the sort one doesn\u2019t usually comes across in impoverished Martinaise. Joyce is a treasure trove of knowledge for an amnesiac detective who doesn\u2019t really understand what planet he\u2019s on and how it came to be the way it is. You just might find yourself whiling away some hours with her by the water, listening to the waves lapping against the hull of her sloop, entranced by her erudition and lulling eloquence.\n\nInteractions\nJoyce is met on the first day of the investigation and has multiple opportunities for the world-weary detective. Perhaps the most important one at first is that she can provide the \u2724 130 for the detective to pay off their debt over at the Whirling-in-Rags (\u2724 70 or any other amount if the player already negotiated it down). She passes this obvious bribe off as a... Donation to the RCM, in keeping with the organization's principles of self-funding.\nBy knowing about the Wild Pines annual revenue is 200 billion Real you will gain a +1 modifier(asking her about the Wild Pines)\nBy opting in Mazovian Socio-Economics thought you will gain a +2 modifier.(It's not necessary to internalize it)\nBeyond that, Joyce will also offer information and opportunities for resolving the Get a reality lowdown and Talk to Joyce about the pale without Kim tasks. The former can take quite a bit of time, so keep that in mind, while the latter is a white check that can be bypassed by sending Kim away (eg. with the body) or having a high Esprit de Corps and asking him to step back.\nJoyce also offers The Jam Mystery task to gain Joyce's info on the lynching without having to retrieve your badge. Completing it also offers a Red Logic Check that allows Harry to point out the Scab Leader at the gates of the GRIH, as standing out and a likely member of the merc posse. If Harry loses his brain, Kim will chime in.\nYou can receive more information about the case from Joyce once you find your badge at the crashed Kineema beyond the water lock or by completing a special task for her, tracking down the source of drugs flowing through the GRIH.\nAs a side effect of extended exposure to the Pale in her line of work, Joyce does not sleep.

I will provide you with all the information needed about an individual dog behavior and his master, and your role is to devise the best plan, exercises and obedience training for the master to train his dog. You should use your knowledge of dog training and other relevant factors in order to create a plan suitable for them. My first request is \"I need help, one of my dogs is chewing my shoes when I'm not home.\"\n\nPlease write in English language."}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Thank you for reaching out for help with your dog's behavior. Chewing on shoes can be a frustrating and destructive behavior for dog owners. Here are some steps and exercises that can help you address this behavior:\n\n1. Ensure your dog has plenty of appropriate chew toys: Dogs naturally have a strong desire to chew, and providing them with appropriate chew toys can redirect their behavior away from your shoes. Consider giving your dog a variety of chew toys made from different materials such as rubber, nylon, or rope. Rotate the toys frequently to keep them interesting.\n2. Increase exercise and mental stimulation: Dogs who are bored or under-stimulated are more likely to engage in destructive behaviors such as chewing. Increase your dog's exercise and mental stimulation by taking them for longer walks, playing fetch, and engaging them in interactive games such as hide and seek or scent work.\n3. Crate training: If your dog is chewing on shoes when you're not home, it may be helpful to crate train them. A crate can provide a safe and comfortable space for your dog when you're not around to supervise them. Make sure the crate is appropriately sized for your dog and that they have access to water and appropriate chew toys.\n4. Positive reinforcement training: Positive reinforcement training involves rewarding your dog for good behavior rather than punishing them for bad behavior. When you catch your dog chewing on a chew toy instead of your shoes, praise and reward them with treats or playtime. This will reinforce the desired behavior and encourage your dog to chew on appropriate items.\n5. Teach the \"leave it\" command: Teaching your dog the \"leave it\" command can be helpful in preventing them from chewing on inappropriate items. Start by holding a low-value item, such as a piece of kibble, in your hand and saying \"leave it.\" When your dog looks away from the item, praise and reward them with a higher value treat such as a piece of chicken. Gradually increase the value of the item you're asking your dog to leave until they can reliably \"leave\" items such as shoes.\n\nRemember that training takes time and consistency, so be patient with your dog and continue to reinforce good behavior. If you're struggling with this behavior, consider consulting with a professional dog trainer who can provide personalized advice and guidance.\n\n"}], "id": "1In2BNg", "lang": "en"}

The producer can then change the visibility timeout of the message later on, before it becomes visible to consumers, by using the `changeMessageVisibility` method and passing the `ReceiptHandle` of the message and the new `VisibilityTimeout` value in seconds.\n\nFor example, if the producer initially sets a delay of 5 hours, then after 4 hours the producer wants to change it to 6 hours, it can use the `changeMessageVisibility` method to change the visibility timeout to 6 hours:\n\n\n```\nsqs.changeMessageVisibility({\n QueueUrl: 'https://sqs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/123456789012/MyQueue',\n ReceiptHandle: data.ReceiptHandle,\n VisibilityTimeout: 60 * 60 * 6\n }, (err, data) => {\n if (err) {\n console.error(err);\n } else {\n console.log(data);\n }\n});\n```\nThis way the message will become visible to consumers in 6 hours after the message is sent.\n\nKeep in mind that the `ReceiptHandle` is not a permanent ID and it can be used only once, so you need to refresh the handle if you want to perform another action on the same message.\nAlso, as I mentioned earlier, SQS guarantees \"at-least-once\" delivery but not \"exactly-once\" delivery, meaning that a message may be delivered more than once to consumers, so you should implement additional logic (e.g. using a unique identifier for each message) to detect and discard duplicate messages.\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "got it"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "I'm glad that it's clear now.

It is commonly used to treat hip fractures in elderly patients, as it can help reduce pain, improve mobility, and restore function to the affected joint.\n\nThere is a significant body of evidence to support the use of cemented hip arthroplasty in elderly patients with hip fractures. Studies have consistently shown that cemented hip arthroplasty can provide excellent short- and long-term clinical outcomes in these patients, including improved pain relief, increased mobility, and reduced risk of complications.\n\nOne study published in the Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma found that cemented hip arthroplasty resulted in significantly higher rates of successful pain relief and functional improvement in elderly patients with hip fractures compared to non-surgical treatment. Another study published in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery found that cemented hip arthroplasty was associated with significantly lower rates of re-operation and revision surgery in elderly patients with hip fractures compared to uncemented hip arthroplasty.\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that cemented hip arthroplasty is a safe and effective treatment option for elderly patients with hip fractures, and can help improve their quality of life and functional outcomes. It is important to note, however, that as with any surgical procedure, cemented hip arthroplasty carries certain risks and complications, and the decision to undergo the procedure should be made on an individual basis with the guidance of a healthcare professional.\n\n"}], "id": "TBmlQwu", "lang": "en"}

Transparency: With explainable AI, users will have more insight into how the algorithm is making decisions and recommending routes. This can improve user trust and satisfaction.\n2. Fairness: Dynamic route optimization algorithms can sometimes make decisions that are biased towards certain demographics or areas. Explainable AI can help identify and address these biases, leading to more equitable routing recommendations.\n3.

This means that the `os` module is not accessible as a regular Python module, and cannot be imported using the usual import syntax.\n\nIf you need to work with the `os` module in its unfrozen form, you may need to install it as a separate package using a package manager like `pip`.\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "How would I do that?"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "To install the `os` module as a separate package using `pip`, you will need to have `pip` installed on your system.

{"conversations": [{"user": "human", "text": "Create an RLHF model with pytorch to retrain a deep learning model based on thumbs up and thumbs down reaction from the User"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Sure, I can help you create an RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) model using PyTorch to retrain a deep learning model based on thumbs up and thumbs down reactions from the user. Here is an example implementation:\n\nFirst, let's import the necessary libraries:\n\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.optim as optim\nimport numpy as np\n```\nNext, we will define the deep learning model that we want to retrain. In this example, we will use a simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer:\n\n\n```python\nclass MyModel(nn.Module):\n def \\_\\_init\\_\\_(self, input\\_size, hidden\\_size, output\\_size):\n super(MyModel, self).__init__()\n self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)\n self.relu = nn.ReLU()\n self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)\n self.softmax = nn.Softmax(dim=1)\n\n def forward(self, x):\n x = self.fc1(x)\n x = self.relu(x)\n x = self.fc2(x)\n x = self.softmax(x)\n return x\n```\nNow, let's define the RLHF agent. We will use the REINFORCE algorithm to update the model weights based on the user's feedback. We will also use a buffer to store the experiences (state, action, reward) of the agent during each episode:\n\n\n```python\nclass RLHFAgent():\n def \\_\\_init\\_\\_(self, input\\_size, hidden\\_size, output\\_size, learning\\_rate):\n self.model = MyModel(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)\n self.optimizer = optim.Adam(self.model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)\n self.buffer = []\n\n def select\\_action(self, state):\n state = torch.from_numpy(state).float().unsqueeze(0)\n probs = self.model(state)\n m = torch.distributions.Categorical(probs)\n action = m.sample()\n self.buffer.append((state, action))\n return action.item()\n\n def update\\_model(self, rewards):\n policy_loss = []\n for i, (state, action) in enumerate(self.buffer):\n reward = rewards[i]\n m = torch.distributions.Categorical(self.model(state))\n loss = -m.log_prob(action) * reward\n policy_loss.append(loss)\n self.optimizer.zero_grad()\n policy_loss = torch.stack(policy_loss).sum()\n policy_loss.backward()\n self.optimizer.step()\n self.buffer = []\n```\nFinally, we can use the RLHF agent to interact with the user and update the model weights. In this example, we will assume that the user provides a thumbs up or thumbs down reaction to each state:\n\n\n```python\nagent = RLHFAgent(input_size=10, hidden_size=5, output_size=2, learning_rate=0.001)\n\n# Assume we have a list of states (10-dimensional vectors) to classify\nstates = np.random.rand(100, 10)\n\nfor state in states:\n action = agent.select_action(state)\n\n # Assume the user provides a thumbs up or thumbs down reaction to the action\n user_feedback = input(\"Did you like the action? (y/n)\")\n\n if user_feedback == 'y':\n reward = 1\n else:\n reward = -1\n\n agent.update_model([reward])\n```\nIn this example, we randomly generate 100 states and classify each state using the RLHF agent. For each action, we ask the user for feedback and update the model weights using the REINFORCE algorithm. The RLHF agent learns to associate positive feedback with good actions and negative feedback with bad actions, and uses this feedback to update the model weights to improve its performance.\n\n"}], "id": "98whhki", "lang": "en"}

{"conversations": [{"user": "human", "text": "write a 2-page report virtual address and physical address (in the terms of microprocessor)"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Introduction\nIn modern computer systems, memory is a fundamental resource. When a program is executed, it is loaded into the memory for execution. The microprocessor interacts with memory using two types of addresses, virtual address, and physical address. In this report, we will discuss virtual address and physical address, their differences, and how they are used in microprocessors.\n\nVirtual Address\nA virtual address is an address that a process uses to access memory. It is called a virtual address because it is not the actual physical location of the data. Instead, the virtual address is translated by the operating system into a physical address that the memory controller uses to retrieve the data from memory. The virtual address space is divided into different sections. Each section has its own virtual address, which is used to access memory. This allows each process to have its own virtual address space, which provides an extra layer of security and isolation.\n\nVirtual memory is a technique used by modern operating systems to allow processes to access more memory than is physically available. Virtual memory uses a combination of physical memory and disk storage to provide a larger address space than the physical memory alone. The operating system manages the virtual memory and ensures that the most frequently used pages are stored in physical memory, while the least frequently used pages are swapped out to disk storage.\n\nPhysical Address\nA physical address is the actual address of a memory location in the system. It is the address that the memory controller uses to retrieve data from memory. Physical addresses are assigned by the hardware and are unique to each memory location in the system. Physical memory is divided into pages, which are fixed-size blocks of memory. The page size is determined by the hardware and is typically 4KB or 8KB.\n\nWhen a program is loaded into memory, it is loaded into a series of physical pages. Each physical page is assigned a physical address by the hardware. The physical address space is contiguous, meaning that each physical page is located next to the previous one in memory. The physical address space is managed by the memory controller, which ensures that each physical page is mapped to the correct location in the virtual address space.\n\nVirtual Address vs. Physical Address\nThe main difference between virtual address and physical address is that a virtual address is used by the process to access memory, while a physical address is used by the memory controller to retrieve data from memory. The virtual address is translated by the operating system into a physical address before it is sent to the memory controller. The virtual address space is divided into sections, while the physical address space is contiguous.\n\nVirtual memory allows processes to access more memory than is physically available. It does this by using a combination of physical memory and disk storage. When a process needs to access memory that is not currently in physical memory, the operating system swaps out a page of memory to disk storage and loads the required page into physical memory. This allows processes to use more memory than is physically available, which improves the performance of the system.\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, virtual address and physical address are two types of addresses used in modern computer systems. Virtual address is used by the process to access memory, while physical address is used by the memory controller to retrieve data from memory. Virtual memory is a technique used by modern operating systems to allow processes to access more memory than is physically available. The virtual address space is divided into sections, while the physical address space is contiguous. Understanding virtual address and physical address is essential for understanding how modern computer systems manage memory.\n\n"}], "id": "LToFBh3", "lang": "en"}

With a framework, the developer must adhere to the structure and conventions of the framework, and the framework handles much of the underlying logic of the application.\n\nTo further illustrate the difference, consider a scenario where a developer wants to build a web application that involves data visualization. They could use a library like D3.js to create interactive charts and graphs, and incorporate them into their own custom web application. In contrast, if they wanted to build the entire web application using a framework, they might choose something like Ruby on Rails or Django, which provide a complete structure for building web applications, including models, views, and controllers.\n\nIn summary, while both libraries and frameworks are useful tools for developers, the key difference lies in the level of control they offer and the scope of the tasks they can help to accomplish. A library provides specific functionality, while a framework provides a structure for building an entire application.\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": " For each of the following technologies/techniques state which one of the\nfollowing concerns; (Frontend, App Server, Persistence, Web Server) they help\naddress.\na.

DNS lookup: The domain name in the URL is resolved to an IP address using the Domain Name System (DNS). This allows the client to locate the server that hosts the website.\n2. TCP connection: The client establishes a TCP connection with the server. This involves a three-way handshake where the client sends a SYN message to the server, the server responds with a SYN-ACK message, and the client sends an ACK message back to the server. This establishes a reliable, bi-directional communication channel between the client and the server.\n3. HTTP request: The client sends an HTTP request to the server using the TCP connection. The request typically includes a method (such as GET or POST), a URL, headers, and a body (for POST requests). The headers may include information about the client, such as the user agent and any cookies that have been set.\n4. Server processing: The server receives the HTTP request and processes it. This typically involves parsing the request, looking up the requested resource (such as a web page or an image) on the server's file system or in a database, and generating a response.\n5. HTTP response: The server sends an HTTP response back to the client using the same TCP connection. The response typically includes a status code (such as 200 OK or 404 Not Found), headers (including any cookies that the server wants to set), and a body (containing the requested resource or an error message).\n6. Client processing: The client receives the HTTP response and processes it. This typically involves parsing the response, checking the status code to determine if the request was successful or not, and rendering the response to the user (such as displaying a web page or an image).\n7. TCP connection teardown: Once the HTTP response has been received and processed, the client and server tear down the TCP connection. This involves a four-way handshake where the client sends a FIN message to the server, the server responds with a FIN-ACK message, the server sends a FIN message back to the client, and the client responds with a FIN-ACK message. This releases the resources that were allocated for the connection and allows both the client and server to move on to other tasks.\n\nOverall, the HTTP request process allows clients to communicate with servers over the internet and retrieve resources such as web pages, images, and other types of data.\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "What is client side programming?\n"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Client-side programming refers to the process of writing code (usually in JavaScript) that runs on the client-side of a web application, meaning it runs on the user's web browser. The client-side code is responsible for handling the user interface and user interactions, and can communicate with the server-side of the web application to fetch data, submit forms, and update the state of the application.\n\nIn client-side programming, the focus is on creating a responsive and interactive user interface that runs smoothly on the client's browser. This includes handling user events like clicks and keyboard inputs, and updating the UI in real-time based on user actions. Common tasks in client-side programming include validating form inputs, creating animations and visual effects, and fetching data from APIs.\n\nClient-side programming is typically done using JavaScript, which is a popular scripting language used to create dynamic web applications. Other front-end technologies like HTML and CSS are also used to build the user interface, but JavaScript is the primary language for client-side programming. There are also many popular libraries and frameworks like React, Vue.js, and Angular that are used to simplify client-side programming and make it easier to create complex web applications.\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "When a web server hosts javascript code, can it be executed on the server?\n"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "No, when a web server hosts JavaScript code, it cannot be executed on the server. JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means it is executed on the client-side (i.e., the user's web browser), not the server-side.\n\nWhen a user requests a web page that contains JavaScript code, the web server sends the code to the user's web browser as part of the HTML response. The web browser then downloads and executes the JavaScript code on the client-side, which allows for dynamic and interactive web pages.\n\nThere are other server-side scripting languages like PHP, Python, and Ruby that can be used to execute code on the server-side, but JavaScript is not one of them. However, there are some technologies like Node.js that allow JavaScript code to be executed on the server-side, but this requires a separate server-side runtime environment and is not the default behavior for web servers.\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "What is the difference between a web server and an application server?\n"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "A web server and an application server are two different types of servers that serve different purposes.\n\nA web server is a server that is responsible for serving static content like HTML pages, images, videos, and other files to web browsers. When a user requests a web page, the web server receives the request, retrieves the relevant file(s) from the file system, and sends the content back to the client's web browser. The web server typically uses the HTTP protocol to communicate with web browsers and may support other protocols like HTTPS, FTP, and SMTP.\n\nAn application server, on the other hand, is a server that is responsible for serving dynamic content like web applications, APIs, and other software services. An application server provides a runtime environment for running server-side code that can handle more complex tasks like data processing, authentication, and access control. The application server may also interact with databases, message queues, and other backend services to perform its tasks.\n\nIn summary, the main difference between a web server and an application server is the type of content they serve. A web server serves static content like web pages and files, while an application server serves dynamic content like web applications and APIs. However, in practice, the distinction between these two types of servers is not always clear-cut, and many modern web servers also include application server functionality.\n\n"}], "id": "6hVGSGD", "lang": "en"}

One of the most severe consequences of inadequate food consumption is scavenging. Scavenging refers to the act of searching for food in garbage dumps, waste bins, or other places where food waste is discarded. It is a desperate and often dangerous practice that exposes individuals to a range of health risks.\n\nScavenging is a direct consequence of poverty and food insecurity. When people do not have access to enough food, they are forced to resort to scavenging to survive. This is a common problem in many developing countries where poverty and hunger are rampant. In these places, scavenging is often the only way for people to find enough food to feed themselves and their families.\n\nScavenging is a severe consequence of inadequate food consumption because it exposes individuals to a range of health risks. Food waste is often contaminated with harmful substances such as bacteria, viruses, and chemicals. When people scavenge for food, they are at risk of contracting illnesses such as food poisoning, cholera, and other infections. In addition, scavenging often involves digging through trash and waste, which can expose individuals to sharp objects, broken glass, and other hazards.\n\nFurthermore, scavenging can also have a negative impact on a person's dignity and self-esteem. When people are forced to scavenge for food, they often feel ashamed and embarrassed. This can lead to a loss of self-respect and a feeling of hopelessness, which can have long-lasting effects on their mental and emotional well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, scavenging is indeed the most severe consequence of inadequate food consumption. It is a desperate and dangerous practice that exposes individuals to a range of health risks and can have a negative impact on their dignity and self-esteem. Therefore, it is important for governments and other organizations to work towards providing access to adequate food and reducing poverty and food insecurity, in order to prevent this severe consequence from occurring.\n\n"}], "id": "AhotMkT", "lang": "en"}

The Roaring Twenties and the Culture of Consumerism: The 1920s were known as the Roaring Twenties, a time of great economic prosperity and cultural change in America. One of the defining characteristics of this era was the rise of consumerism, and William Wrigley Jr. was a master of marketing his brand and products to the American public. The Wrigley Ocean Marathon was a way for him to capture the attention of the public and promote his brand.\n2. The Jazz Age and the Rise of Spectator Sports: The 1920s were also known as the Jazz Age, a time of cultural rebellion and the emergence of new forms of entertainment. One of the most popular forms of entertainment was spectator sports, and the Wrigley Ocean Marathon was a unique event that captured the imagination of the public. The race was a daring feat of endurance and athleticism, and it showcased the thrill of competition that was so popular in the 1920s.\n3.

Their ideas have been the subject of debate and criticism for many years, and opinions on their work vary widely depending on one's perspective and political orientation.\n\nWhile some people may disagree with certain aspects of their ideas, others may find their theories to be insightful and relevant. It is important to recognize that Marx and Engels were writing in a particular historical context, and their work reflected their observations of the social, economic, and political conditions of their time.

Many workers' organizations have adopted Marxist principles and tactics to fight for better wages, working conditions, and social justice.\n2. Socialism and communism: Marx and Engels's philosophy is closely associated with socialism and communism, which are political ideologies that advocate for the collective ownership of the means of production and the elimination of private property. Although communism as a political system has largely fallen out of favor, socialist and Marxist ideas continue to shape political discourse and policy debates in many countries.\n3. Critiques of capitalism: Marx and Engels's critique of capitalism as a system that creates inequality, exploitation, and alienation remains relevant today, and their ideas continue to influence debates about economic inequality and the role of the state in regulating markets.\n4. Academic and intellectual inquiry: Marxist theory has had a significant impact on academic disciplines such as sociology, political science, and economics, as well as on intellectual movements such as critical theory and postmodernism.\n5. Cultural and artistic production: Marxist ideas have also influenced cultural and artistic production, with many writers, artists, and musicians drawing on Marxist themes and concepts in their work.\n\nOverall, Marx and Engels's philosophy continues to have a significant impact on political, social, and cultural discourse today, and their ideas remain relevant and contested in a wide range of contexts.\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "A lot of people think Marx and Engels's philosophy is no longer fit for today's society.

Some argue that the rise of liberal democracy, globalization, and the spread of market economies have rendered Marxist ideas obsolete, while others point to the failures of communist regimes in the 20th century as evidence that Marxist theory is fundamentally flawed.\n\nHowever, it is important to recognize that Marx and Engels's philosophy was never intended to provide a blueprint for a specific political or economic system. Rather, it was a critical analysis of the social and economic conditions of their time, and a call to action to address the injustices and inequalities that they saw in capitalist societies. As such, many of the insights and critiques that they offered remain relevant and valuable today, even if their specific prescriptions for social and political change are not universally accepted.\n\nFor example, many of the problems that Marx and Engels identified in capitalist societies, such as the concentration of wealth and power, the exploitation of workers, and the alienation of individuals from their labor and from each other, continue to be major challenges in contemporary society. Moreover, the recent global financial crisis, rising income inequality, and political polarization in many countries have led to renewed interest in Marxist ideas and critiques of capitalism.\n\nWhile it is true that Marx and Engels's philosophy may not provide all of the answers to the complex problems facing modern societies, it remains an important and influential body of thought that can help us to better understand the social and economic forces that shape our world, and to imagine alternative futures that are more just and equitable.\n\n"}], "id": "2mGDmjv", "lang": "en"}

{"conversations": [{"user": "human", "text": "Dynamic student feedback form using usecontext in react"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "To create a dynamic student feedback form using `useContext` in React, you first need to set up a context provider that will hold the state and functions for managing the form data. Here is an example:\n\n\n```jsx\nimport React, { useState, useContext } from \"react\";\n\n// Create a new context\nconst FeedbackContext = React.createContext();\n\n// Create a provider component that will hold the state and functions for managing the form data\nconst FeedbackProvider = ({ children }) => {\n const [name, setName] = useState(\"\");\n const [email, setEmail] = useState(\"\");\n const [feedback, setFeedback] = useState(\"\");\n\n const updateName = (name) => {\n setName(name);\n };\n\n const updateEmail = (email) => {\n setEmail(email);\n };\n\n const updateFeedback = (feedback) => {\n setFeedback(feedback);\n };\n\n const resetForm = () => {\n setName(\"\");\n setEmail(\"\");\n setFeedback(\"\");\n };\n\n // Create an object that holds the state and functions that we want to share with other components\n const feedbackState = {\n name,\n email,\n feedback,\n updateName,\n updateEmail,\n updateFeedback,\n resetForm,\n };\n\n // Pass the feedbackState object to the context provider\n return (\n <FeedbackContext.Provider value={feedbackState}>\n {children}\n </FeedbackContext.Provider>\n );\n};\n\n// Create a custom hook that allows us to easily access the feedback state and functions from other components\nconst useFeedback = () => {\n const feedbackState = useContext(FeedbackContext);\n return feedbackState;\n};\n\nexport { FeedbackProvider, useFeedback };\n```\nIn the above code, we create a `FeedbackContext` using the `React.createContext()` method. We then create a `FeedbackProvider` component that holds the state and functions for managing the form data. This provider component takes in `children` as a prop, which represents the child components that will have access to the context.\n\nInside the `FeedbackProvider` component, we create state variables for the name, email, and feedback fields of the form. We also define functions for updating these fields and for resetting the form.\n\nWe then create an object called `feedbackState` that holds the state variables and functions that we want to share with other components. We pass this object to the context provider using the `value` prop.\n\nFinally, we create a custom hook called `useFeedback` that allows other components to easily access the `feedbackState` object. This hook uses the `useContext` hook to retrieve the context and return the `feedbackState` object.\n\nNow that we have set up the context provider and custom hook, we can use them in other components to create the dynamic student feedback form. Here is an example component that uses the `useFeedback` hook:\n\n\n```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport { useFeedback } from \"./FeedbackContext\";\n\nconst FeedbackForm = () => {\n const {\n name,\n email,\n feedback,\n updateName,\n updateEmail,\n updateFeedback,\n resetForm,\n } = useFeedback();\n\n const handleSubmit = (event) => {\n event.preventDefault();\n // Do something with the form data (e.g. submit it to a server)\n resetForm();\n };\n\n return (\n <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n <label htmlFor=\"name\">Name:</label>\n <input\n type=\"text\"\n id=\"name\"\n value={name}\n onChange={(e) => updateName(e.target.value)}\n />\n\n <label htmlFor=\"email\">Email:</label>\n <input\n type=\"email\"\n id=\"email\"\n value={email}\n onChange={(e) =>\n```\n"}], "id": "6UdXk0I", "lang": "en"}

Agile allows for flexibility and adaptability, which can be helpful in handling complex and evolving projects. However, it's important to note that agile is not a one-size-fits-all approach, and it may need to be tailored to the specific needs of your team and project.\n\nFor your team working on technologies with shorter goals, it's understandable that following agile may be challenging. Depending on the specific goals and timelines of these projects, you may want to consider alternative project management approaches that are better suited for shorter-term projects. For example, you may consider using a more traditional project management approach, such as the waterfall method, where the project is divided into distinct phases that must be completed in sequence.\n\nUltimately, the key is to choose a project management approach that fits the needs of your team and project, rather than trying to force a particular methodology that may not be the best fit. It's also important to regularly evaluate and adjust your approach as needed to ensure that it continues to support the goals of your team and project.\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "now i need to setup confluence as well as jira for both team, which will be the recommended way for that ?"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Setting up Confluence and Jira can be a great way to support collaboration and project management for your teams.

For example, the media market has a high degree of concentration among a small number of firms, and the commodities market can be subject to manipulation. The oil market is subject to government intervention and regulation. The automobile market is subject to safety and environmental regulations.\n\nIn the healthcare market, there are several ways in which the market fails to meet these key elements. For example, there is a lack of competition among healthcare providers in many areas, leading to high prices. Additionally, information about the cost and quality of healthcare services is often difficult for consumers to access. There are also significant barriers to entry for new healthcare providers, and the market is heavily influenced by government regulations and insurance companies.\n\nGovernment and regulation play an important role in fixing or repairing missing or broken elements of the market in healthcare. For example, regulations are used to ensure that healthcare providers meet certain standards and to protect consumers from fraud and abuse. Additionally, government programs such as Medicaid and Medicare help to make healthcare more affordable for vulnerable populations.\n\nIn conclusion, a market is a system in which buyers and sellers interact to exchange goods and services at mutually agreed upon prices.

Zellij's built-in copy mode: Zellij has a built-in copy mode that allows you to select text using the arrow keys and then copy it to the clipboard. To enter copy mode, press `Ctrl + Alt + C`. You can then use the arrow keys to select the text you want to copy, and press `Enter` to copy it to the clipboard.\n2. Tmux integration: Zellij has built-in support for Tmux integration, which allows you to use Tmux commands to copy text from the terminal. To enable Tmux integration, add the following line to your `zellij.yml` configuration file:\n\n\n```yaml\nfeatures:\n tmux-integration: true\n```\nOnce you've enabled Tmux integration, you can use Tmux commands to copy text from the terminal. For example, you can use the Tmux command `copy-mode` (`Ctrl + B` followed by `[`) to enter copy mode, and then use the arrow keys to select text. To copy the selected text to the clipboard, press `Ctrl + W`.\n3. Shell redirection: You can also use shell redirection to output the contents of the terminal to a file, which you can then open and copy to the clipboard using your system's file manager. For example, to output the entire scrollback buffer to a file named `output.txt`, you can use the following command:\n\n\n```c\nzellij --log-file output.txt\n```\nThis will output the entire scrollback buffer to the file `output.txt`.

You may need to install a different version of Vim or recompile Vim with clipboard support.\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "none of these work. just tell me how to quicly get a file to my desktop and it solves my rpoblem"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "If you want to quickly transfer a file from your terminal session in Zellij to your desktop, you can use the `scp` command to copy the file over SSH.\n\nHere's an example of how to use `scp` to transfer a file named `myfile.txt` from your Zellij session to your desktop:\n\n1. Open a new terminal window outside of Zellij on your local machine.\n2. In the new terminal window, use the `scp` command to copy the file from your remote machine to your local machine, like this:\n\n\n```ruby\nscp user@remote:/path/to/myfile.txt ~/Desktop/\n```\nReplace `user` with your remote username, `remote` with the name or IP address of your remote machine, and `/path/to/myfile.txt` with the path to the file you want to transfer. The `~/Desktop/` part of the command specifies the destination directory on your local machine (in this case, your desktop).\n3. Enter your remote password when prompted, if necessary.\n4. The file should now be transferred to your desktop.\n\nNote that you'll need SSH access to the remote machine in order to use `scp`. If you don't have SSH access, you may need to use a different method to transfer the file.\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "earlier i noticed zellij saved a file to my local machine instead of the host i was sshd on"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "It's possible that Zellij saved the file to your local machine instead of the remote host if you were using Zellij's local mode instead of SSH mode. In local mode, Zellij runs on your local machine and connects to a local shell session, rather than connecting to a remote machine over SSH.\n\nTo check if you're in local mode or SSH mode, you can look at the top bar of the Zellij window. If you're in SSH mode, you should see the name of the remote host and the name of the shell you're connected to. If you're in local mode, you should see the name of your local machine and the name of the shell you're connected to.\n\nIf you're in SSH mode and Zellij saved a file to your local machine, it may be due to a misconfiguration or a bug. In this case, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Check the Zellij log files to see if there were any error messages related to the file save operation. You can find the Zellij log files in the `~/.zellij/logs/` directory.\n2. Check the Zellij configuration file (`~/.zellij/zellij.yml`) to make sure that the default directory for file saves is set to the remote machine's file system, rather than your local machine's file system. You can check this by looking for the `default_save_dir` option in the configuration file.\n3. If the issue persists, you can try reinstalling Zellij or filing a bug report with the Zellij development team.\n\nI hope this helps!\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "one of the most important things i do is grab scrollback or log output and put it into a ticket. i need a reliable way to do that clean.  its disgustingly hard to copy paste terminal output.  give me a few ways of accomplishing this"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "I understand that copying and pasting terminal output can be challenging at times, especially when dealing with large amounts of text or formatting issues. Here are a few ways you can accomplish this more reliably:\n\n1. Use a dedicated terminal emulator with better copy-pasting capabilities. Some terminal emulators, such as Terminator, have features like \"copy on select\" or \"line wrapping\" that can make copying and pasting text much easier.\n2. Use a text editor to edit and format the output before copying it. If you're having trouble copying and pasting terminal output, you can try copying the output into a text editor like Vim or Emacs, where you can edit and format the text as needed before copying it to the clipboard.\n3. Use shell redirection to save the output to a file, which you can then copy and paste from. You can redirect the output of a command to a file using the `>` or `>>` operators. For example, to save the output of a command to a file named `output.txt`, you can use the following command:\n\n\n```bash\ncommand > output.txt\n```\nYou can then open the file in a text editor or copy and paste the contents directly from the file.\n4. Use a clipboard manager to save and manage multiple items on the clipboard. Clipboard managers like CopyQ or ClipIt can be helpful for managing multiple items on the clipboard and accessing them later.\n\nI hope one of these suggestions helps you to copy and paste terminal output more reliably!\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "i use zellij, and vim to look at scrollback within zellij. give me my complet eworkflolw and ill practice it.  say i need to pull some huge logs and quicly get them to a ticket in a browser. whats the most pro way of doing it"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Here is a workflow you can use to pull logs in Zellij, view them in Vim, and copy them to a ticket in a browser:\n\n1. Connect to the remote machine and open Zellij.\n2. Use the arrow keys or other movement keys to scroll through the terminal output until you find the logs you want to copy.\n3. Enter Vim's visual mode by pressing the `v` key.\n4. Use the arrow keys or other movement keys to select the text you want to copy.\n5. Once the text is selected, press the `\"+y` command to copy it to the system clipboard.\n6. Open a new tab in your browser and navigate to the ticket you want to update.\n7. Click on the text field where you want to paste the logs.\n8. Paste the logs into the text field using the standard paste command (`Ctrl + V` on most systems).\n9. If the logs are too large to paste directly into the text field, you can save them to a file using shell redirection (as described in my previous response) and then attach the file to the ticket using the ticket system's attachment feature.\n\nNote that this workflow assumes that you have SSH access to the remote machine and that the remote machine has a command-line interface for viewing and copying logs. If the logs are stored in a graphical interface, you may need to use a different workflow to access and copy them.\n\nAlso note that this workflow assumes that you have a clipboard manager installed on your system. If you don't have a clipboard manager, you may need to install one to access previous items on the clipboard.\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "yeah taht worked"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Great! I'm glad to hear that the workflow worked for you. If you have any further questions or need any additional help, feel free to ask.\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "give me more pro tips, i want to be a wizard of running scripts and moving about the terminal"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Sure, here are some additional pro tips for working with scripts and moving around the terminal:\n\n1. Use aliases and functions to simplify common tasks. Aliases and functions can save you time and make your workflow more efficient by allowing you to run complex or frequently-used commands with a single short command. For example, you can create an alias to quickly navigate to a specific directory:\n\n\n```bash\nalias mydir='cd /path/to/my/dir'\n```\nYou can then type `mydir` to navigate to the directory `/path/to/my/dir`.\n2. Use the `tmux` or `screen` terminal multiplexer to run multiple sessions and switch between them. Terminal multiplexers allow you to split your terminal window into multiple panes or windows, each with its own shell session. This can be helpful for running multiple scripts or tasks simultaneously, or for keeping multiple terminal sessions organized. `tmux` and `screen` are popular terminal multiplexers that you can install and use on most Unix-like systems.\n3. Use the `history` command to recall and reuse previous commands. The `history` command shows a list of all the commands you've run in the current shell session. You can use the arrow keys or type `!` followed by the command number to recall and run previous commands. For example, if you want to re-run the command you ran three commands ago, you can type:\n\n\n```\ndiff!-3\n```\n4. Use file globbing to work with multiple files at once. File globbing allows you to specify multiple files or directories using wildcards or regular expressions. For example, if you want to list all the files in a directory that have a `.txt` extension, you can use the following command:\n\n\n```bash\nls *.txt\n```\nThis will list all the files in the current directory that end with `.txt`.\n5. Use SSH agent forwarding to securely run scripts on remote machines. SSH agent forwarding allows you to securely authenticate with a remote machine using your local SSH key, without storing your key on the remote machine. This can be helpful for running scripts or commands on a remote machine without needing to enter your password or copy your SSH key to the remote machine. To use SSH agent forwarding, add the `-A` option when you connect to the remote machine using SSH:\n\n\n```css\nssh -A user@remote\n```\nThis will enable SSH agent forwarding for the current SSH session. You can then run scripts or commands on the remote machine as if you were running them locally.\n\nI hope these pro tips help you to become a wizard of running scripts and moving around the terminal!\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "cool. so ususally i am doing a few things on on ssh connection, maybe running a few dif commands quickly back to back, cehcking output, reading in the broswre and uploading logs to ticket notes. often i run lots of complex scripts sequentially . give me 10 new tips for this workflow."}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "\u200b\n\n"}], "id": "UuPGToV", "lang": "en"}

Her name was Mary, and I met her at a charity event in a local community center. She was in her late 80s, and she had an amazing energy about her that was infectious.\n\nWe were both volunteering at the event, and I was assigned to help her with her tasks for the day. We ended up chatting a lot, and I learned that she used to be a nurse during World War II. She had some really incredible stories about her experiences during that time, and it was fascinating to hear about it from someone who had actually lived through it.\n\nAfter we finished volunteering, we went out for coffee and kept talking. It was really cool to see how passionate she still was about life, even at her age. She had a really positive attitude and was still interested in learning new things and meeting new people.\n\nOverall, I think Mary was such an interesting person because of her experiences and her energy. She was full of life, and it was inspiring to see someone who had lived such a long life still be so engaged with the world around her.\n\nPart 3:\n\n1. Yes, I definitely think that old people and young people can share interests. While they may come from different generations and have had different experiences, there are still plenty of things that can connect them. For example, music is something that transcends age, and people of all ages can appreciate the same song. Additionally, hobbies like gardening, reading, or playing sports can also be enjoyed by people of all ages. It's important to remember that age is just a number, and people are more alike than they are different.\n2. Old people can teach young people so much! One thing that comes to mind is wisdom. Older people have lived through more experiences and can offer advice and guidance to younger people who may not have experienced certain things yet. Additionally, older people can provide a historical perspective that younger people may not have. For example, they can talk about what life was like before technology or what it was like to live through a major event like a war or a recession.\n3. I think there are definitely benefits when one person is interested in another person. When we take an interest in someone, we show that we care about them and value their thoughts and experiences. This can lead to stronger relationships and deeper connections with others. Additionally, when we take the time to learn about other people, we can gain new perspectives and broaden our own horizons.

Here are some key factors to keep in mind:\n\n1. Adjustability: Chairs and delivery systems should be adjustable to accommodate patients of different sizes and heights. The height of the chair or system should be easily adjustable to ensure that the patient's feet are flat on the floor, and their knees are at a 90-degree angle. The backrest should be adjustable to provide support for the patient's spine.\n2. Comfort: The chair or system should be designed with comfortable padding and upholstery that is easy to clean and maintain. Armrests and footrests should also be provided to help patients relax and stay comfortable during procedures.\n3. Accessibility: Patient chairs and delivery systems should be designed for easy access by healthcare providers. They should be positioned at the appropriate height and angle to allow for easy access to the patient's mouth or other areas that require treatment.\n4.

further information about the technology stack and the requirements of the project. However, I can provide a general guideline for creating a GUI for CRUD operations:\n\n1. Choose a front-end framework or library such as React, Angular, or Vue.js.\n2. Create a component for the entity that includes input fields for each attribute of the entity.\n3. Use state to hold the input values of the fields.\n4. Create a function to handle the form submission, which sends a POST request to the backend API.\n5. Create a function to handle the update operation, which sends a PUT request to the backend API.\n6. Create a function to handle the delete operation, which sends a DELETE request to the backend API.\n7. Create a function to fetch the entity data from the backend API and render it in a table or list format.\n8.

The user can fill in the fields and click on a \"Save\" button to submit the form to the server for creation or update.\n\n\n```php\npublic function showForm() {\n echo '<form method=\"POST\">';\n foreach ($this->fieldDefs as $field => $type) {\n echo '<label>' . $field . '</label>';\n echo '<input type=\"text\" name=\"' . $field . '\" value=\"' . htmlspecialchars($this->$field) . '\">';\n }\n echo '<button type=\"submit\" name=\"save\">Save</button>';\n echo '</form>';\n}\n```\n2. `showDataGrid()`: This function will display a data grid with all the records of the entity. The user can edit or delete each record.\n\n\n```php\npublic function showDataGrid() {\n $records = $this->selectAll();\n echo '<table>';\n echo '<tr><th>Actions</th>';\n foreach ($this->fieldDefs as $field => $type) {\n echo '<th>' . $field .

'</td>';\n }\n echo '</tr>';\n }\n echo '</table>';\n}\n```\nNote: The code above assumes that you have a function called `selectAll()` in your `ObjectRelationalHybrid` class that returns all the records of the entity. Also, the `showDataGrid()` function generates HTML code for a table with an \"Actions\" column that contains links to edit or delete each record.\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "Go on"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "3. `processForm()`: This function will process the form submitted by the user and create or update a record in the entity.

It then retrieves the result set using the `fetch_assoc()` function and constructs an array of records that match the query.\n\nWe can then modify the `getDataGrid()` function to accept an optional query string that will be used to retrieve the data.

'\">Delete</a></td></tr>';\n }\n $html .= '</tbody></table>';\n return $html;\n}\n```\nThis function first checks if a custom query string is provided. If so, it calls the `customQuery()` function to retrieve the records that match the query. Otherwise, it uses the default query to retrieve all records in the entity.\n\nThe function then generates an HTML table to display the records. The table headers are generated based on the field definitions in `$fieldDefs`, and each record is displayed as a row in the table. The last column in each row contains links to edit or delete the corresponding record.\n\nWith these changes, users can now pass a custom query to the `getDataGrid()` function to display a filtered or sorted view of the entity.\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "List instance variables and function headers of ObjectRelationalHybrid class"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Sure, here are the instance variables and function headers for the `ObjectRelationalHybrid` class:\n\n\n```php\nclass ObjectRelationalHybrid {\n private $fields;\n private $tableName;\n private $primaryKey;\n private $data;\n private $dbPath;\n\n public function \\_\\_construct($tableName, $fields, $primaryKey, $dbPath = \"./data/\") {}\n\n public function createTable() {}\n\n public function insert($record) {}\n\n public function delete($id) {}\n\n public function update($id, $record) {}\n\n public function get($id) {}\n\n public function select($fields = array(), $where = array()) {}\n\n public function innerJoin($table, $fields, $joinField, $where = array()) {}\n\n public function leftJoin($table, $fields, $joinField, $where = array()) {}\n\n public function rightJoin($table, $fields, $joinField, $where = array()) {}\n\n public function showForm($id = null) {}\n\n public function showDataGrid($fields = array(), $where = array()) {}\n\n private function load() {}\n\n private function save() {}\n\n public function \\_\\_get($name) {}\n\n public function \\_\\_set($name, $value) {}\n\n public function \\_\\_call($name, $arguments) {}\n\n private function validateRecord($record) {}\n\n private function generateFieldInput($field) {}\n\n private function generateFieldDisplay($field, $value = null) {}\n\n private function generateFieldFilter($field) {}\n}\n```\nNote that the actual code for each function is not included here, only the function headers and instance variables.\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "Give use cases with code and snapshots of screen for all new features "}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "I apologize, but as an AI language model, I don't have the ability to provide screenshots of a graphical user interface or generate actual code to demonstrate the use of the enhanced features in the `ObjectRelationalHybrid` class.\n\nHowever, I can provide sample code snippets that show how the new features of the `ObjectRelationalHybrid` class can be used.

Using the `validateRecord` function to validate a record before inserting or updating it:\n\n\n```php\n// Define the validation rules for the record\n$validationRules = array(\n \"name\" => array(\"required\", \"max:255\"),\n \"age\" => array(\"required\", \"integer\"),\n \"email\" => array(\"required\", \"email\")\n);\n\n// Get the record data from the form\n$record = array(\n \"name\" => $\\_POST[\"name\"],\n \"age\" => $\\_POST[\"age\"],\n \"email\" => $\\_POST[\"email\"]\n);\n\n// Validate the record\n$isValid = $myTable->validateRecord($record, $validationRules);\n\n// If the record is valid, insert or update it\nif ($isValid) {\n // If the record has an ID, update it\n if (isset($\\_POST[\"id\"])) {\n $myTable->update($\\_POST[\"id\"], $record);\n }\n // Otherwise, insert a new record\n else {\n $myTable->insert($record);\n }\n\n // Redirect to the data grid page\n header(\"Location: datagrid.php\");\n}\n// Otherwise, show the form with the validation\n```\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "Add decision support to class ObjectRelationalHybrid class\n"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Adding decision support to the `ObjectRelationalHybrid` class would require additional functionality to allow the user to make decisions based on the data in the table.

When we discussed our first contract with the team, we were led to believe that any rent increases would be in the range of 3-5%. This was one of the main reasons we decided to move in in the end. Another reason was the promise of a two-year lease upon renewal. We were clearly informed that the only reason a two or three-year lease was not possible then, was the building's age, even though your webpage suggested otherwise.\n\nHowever, it seems that these conditions have been altered without any prior notice or explanation:\n\n* The monthly rent has increased from 2210\u00a3 to 2450\u00a3, almost a 10%\n* We're told a lease longer than a year is still not possible (even though the webpage still mentions \"lease terms up to 3 years\")\n\nAs we talked about this morning, we would like to remain in the flat, but we have serious reservations about the value of the information we're being given. We would like you to reconsider at least one of these two facts, either a longer lease or any possible mechanism that would result in a lower rent increase.\n\nWe would appreciate a response to our concerns once this has been discussed with management. Until then, we will be considering our options.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your name]\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "Thank you, you're the best!"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "You're welcome!

The resulting padded array `padded_arr` has shape `(2, 5, 8)` representing the original input array with padding added before and after each axis of the last two dimensions.\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "refactor to pad it a batch of sequence"}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Sure, here's a refactored version of the code to pad a batch of sequences using NumPy:\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef batch\\_pad\\_sequences(batch\\_seq, pad\\_value=0):\n \"\"\"\n Pads a batch of variable length sequences to the maximum sequence length.\n\n Args:\n batch\\_seq: List of NumPy arrays representing a batch of sequences.\n pad\\_value: Scalar value to pad the sequences with.\n\n Returns:\n padded\\_seq: NumPy array representing the padded batch of sequences.\n lengths: List of integers representing the original lengths of each sequence\n in the batch.\n \"\"\"\n lengths = [len(seq) for seq in batch_seq]\n max_length = max(lengths)\n padded_seq = np.zeros((len(batch_seq), max_length), dtype=np.int32) + pad_value\n for i, seq in enumerate(batch_seq):\n padded_seq[i, :len(seq)] = seq\n return padded_seq, lengths\n```\nThis function takes a list `batch_seq` of NumPy arrays representing a batch of sequences, and pads them with a specified `pad_value` to the maximum sequence length in the batch.

Appreciate your feedback. I need to create a functional prototype of this game. Can you break the steps required to create the prototype into a list of achievable goals and targets?  "}, {"user": "gpt", "text": "Sure! Here are some steps that you could follow to create a functional prototype of the \"SMASHLAB\" game:\n\n1. Define the gameplay mechanics: The first step in creating a prototype is to define the core gameplay mechanics and how the game will work. This includes deciding on the overall goal of the game (e.g. knock all other players off the map), the role of the attacker and the survivors, and the tools and resources available to each side.\n2. Create a rough game design document: A game design document is a detailed document that outlines the gameplay mechanics, story, and other elements of the game. Creating a rough game design document at this stage will help you to define the scope of the prototype and determine what needs to be included in order to test the core gameplay mechanics.\n3. Build a prototype game engine: The prototype game engine is the software that will be used to create the game. There are a variety of game engines available, ranging from commercial engines like Unreal Engine and Unity to more specialized engines like Phaser and GameMaker. Choose an engine that is well-suited to your needs and has the features you need to build the prototype.\n4. Create the prototype game levels: The prototype game levels are the actual environments in which the gameplay will take place. These levels should be designed to test the core gameplay mechanics and allow you to see how the game is functioning. You can create these levels using a level editor or map editor that is included with the game engine you are using.\n5. Implement the gameplay mechanics: Once you have the prototype game engine and levels set up, it's time to start implementing the gameplay mechanics. This will involve creating the objects and resources available to the attacker and survivors, as well as implementing the mechanics for attacking and defending, such as the cannons and deflectors.\n6. Playtest and iterate: Once you have a basic prototype up and running, it's time to start playtesting the game and gathering feedback. This will help you to identify any issues with the gameplay mechanics and make necessary adjustments. As you playtest and gather feedback, you can iterate on the prototype and continue to refine and improve the gameplay until you have a fully functional prototype.\n\nOverall, creating a functional prototype of a game can be a complex and time-consuming process, but breaking it down into achievable goals and targets can help to make it more manageable. By following these steps, you can create a solid foundation for your game and begin testing and refining the gameplay mechanics.\n\n"}, {"user": "human", "text": "I have everything ready, it's time to program the prototype.

Here is a list of things that you may need to create in order to complete the prototype for the \"SMASHLAB\" game:\n\n* Game engine: You will need to choose a game engine and set it up for your prototype. The game engine is the software that will be used to create the game, and it will handle tasks such as rendering graphics, playing sounds, and handling user input.\n* Game levels: You will need to create the game levels that the gameplay will take place in. These levels should be designed to test the core gameplay mechanics and allow you to see how the game is functioning. You can create these levels using a level editor or map editor that is included with the game engine you are using.\n* Game objects: You will need to create the game objects that the attacker and survivors will use, such as the cannons, deflectors, and other resources. This will involve creating the models, textures, and other assets for these objects, as well as implementing their functionality in the game engine.\n* Game mechanics: You will need to implement the core gameplay mechanics, such as the mechanics for attacking and defending, and the rules for winning and losing the game. This will involve writing code to handle these mechanics and integrating them into the game engine.\n* User interface: You will need to create a user interface (UI) for the game, which will allow players to navigate the game and access various features and options. This will involve creating the UI elements, such as menus, buttons, and other controls, and integrating them into the game engine.\n* Audio: You will need to create or acquire any audio assets that the game will use, such as music, sound effects, and voiceovers. This will involve setting up the audio system in the game engine and integrating the audio assets into the game.\n* Playtesting and iteration: Finally, you will need to playtest the game and gather feedback to identify any issues with the gameplay mechanics and make necessary adjustments. As you playtest and gather feedback, you can iterate on the prototype and continue to refine and improve the gameplay until you have a fully functional prototype.\n\nOverall, there are many different elements that you will need to create in order to complete the prototype for the \"SMASHLAB\" game. By breaking these elements down into manageable tasks, you can focus on completing each one individually and building a solid foundation for your game.\n\n"}], "id": "2HRcc9w", "lang": "en"}
