"Identify the key points from the following story and explain each briefly. The Science Behind Dogs & Cats 

Because of the special bond humans have with their pets, it is no surprise that cats and dogs are two of the most loved pets in the world. But how does the relationship between humans and our furry friends work? Scientists have studied the science behind the interaction between cats and dogs and humans.
 
The science of pet therapy has been well researched by scientists. Studies have shown that when pets and humans interact, the people involved exhibit lower levels of stress hormones and an increased ""feel good"" hormone. Studies have also shown that petting a dog can decrease anxiety and help the person become more relaxed.

Studies have found that cats are less socially interactive than dogs, but they have their own way of communicating with humans. In some cases, cats can hear a stranger's voice and knew who it belonged to without having ever met them before. Cats have been found to be social learners that rely on visual cues to interpret their environment.

The science also includes how cats and dogs adapt to their environment. Dogs are found to be social learners and learn from their environment as well as from humans. They may be able to calm a person with their presence and can be trained to do various tasks. Cats on the other hand are more independent animals and stay close to their surroundings. They can pick up behavioral cues from their environment, more than humans, which is why cats can be so entertaining to watch."
