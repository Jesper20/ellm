"Generate a 100-word synopsis of the following paper describing its main claims and applications. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for learning to play a computer game ""Doom"". The proposed algorithm is a reimplementation of deep deterministic policy gradient with a continuous action space, relying on convolutional neural networks (CNN) in order to map frames of the game to the expected action. The experiments conducted with two variants of the Doom game showed that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline solution in terms of accuracy, demonstrating superior performance with deeper CNNs.

This research demonstrates the feasibility of deep reinforcement learning for game AI. With the help of deep learning techniques, our model is able to apprehend abstract concepts and perform complex navigational tasks, ensuring a high accuracy compared to the traditional approach. Exploring the performance of other deep reinforcement learning algorithms on the Doom games could further improve the overall accuracy.

The applications of the proposed approach can extend beyond game AI to robotic navigation and control tasks, image processing, and decision-making. By embracing more complex reinforcement learning techniques, such as imitation learning, hierarchical learning and meta-learning, the proposed method can be applied in various AI-driven tasks, including robotics and healthcare, combat and autonomous driving."
