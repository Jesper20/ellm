House Democrats are set to begin proceedings on a sweeping bill to overhaul the US tax system. The proposed bill would reduce the number of US citizens paying taxes and would increase the amount of money working Americans owe each year.

The planned bill was introduced by Ways and Means Chairman, Richard Neal, a Democrat representing Massachusetts. The proposed tax plan includes massive cuts to corporate taxes, elimination of the Alternative Minimum Tax, and new tax brackets for middle-class households. It seeks to simplify and streamline the US tax code while protecting middle-class families from the impact of potentially substantial tax increases."
